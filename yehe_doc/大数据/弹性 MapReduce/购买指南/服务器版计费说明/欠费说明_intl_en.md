## Pay-As-You-Go
### Overdue payment alerts

| Type | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overdue payment reminder** | Pay-as-you-go clusters are billed on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators will be notified by email and SMS. |
| **Balance alert** | This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, see "Balance Notifications". |

### Overdue policy
When your account balance falls below zero, a pay-as-you-go cluster can be used for 2 more hours, and the usage will still be deducted from your account. After 2 hours, the cluster will be moved to the recycle bin and become unavailable, and will no longer incur pay-as-you-go costs.

- If a pay-as-you-go cluster is no longer needed, terminate it as soon as possible to avoid incurring further costs.
- After a cluster is terminated, the data in it will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- Because your resource usage changes constantly, the balance alerts may not be precisely accurate.
- You will continue to be charged for associated cloud products such as EIP and CBS during cluster isolation due to overdue payments until your account balance becomes negative.
