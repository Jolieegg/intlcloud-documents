EMR supports six cluster types and their respective use cases and defines five node types. Different cluster types and their respective use cases support different node types, number of deployed nodes, and deployed services. You can select the most appropriate cluster type and use case based on your business needs when creating a cluster.
>? ClickHouse and Doris cluster types are not available by default. To use them, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.

<td >Default</td>
<td >Based on open-source Hadoop and the components that form a Hadoop ecosystem, it provides big data solutions for massive data storage, offline/real-time data analysis, streaming data computing, and machine learning.</td>
<td><ul style="margin:0"><li/><b>Master node: </b>It is a management node that ensures the scheduling of the cluster works properly. Processes such as NameNode, ResourceManager, and HMaster are deployed here. The number of master nodes is 1 in non-HA mode and 2 in HA mode.
<br><b>Note: If Kudu is deployed, the cluster supports only the HA mode, and there are 3 master nodes.</b>
<li/><b>Core node: </b>It is a compute and storage node. All your data in HDFS is stored in core nodes. Therefore, core nodes cannot be scaled in once scaled out to ensure data security. Processes such as DataNode, NodeManager, and RegionServer are deployed here. The number of core nodes is ≥ 2 in non-HA mode and ≥ 3 in HA mode.
<li/><b>Task node: </b>It is a node for computing only and does not store any data. The computed data comes from a core node or COS. Therefore, task nodes are often elastic nodes and can be scaled in or out as needed. Processes such as NodeManager and PrestoWork are deployed here. The number of task nodes can be changed at any time to scale the cluster, with a minimum value of 0. 
<li/><b>Common node: </b>It provides data sharing and syncing and HA fault tolerance services for the master nodes in an HA cluster. Distributed coordinator components such as ZooKeeper and JournalNode are deployed here. The number of common nodes is 0 in non-HA mode and ≥ 3 in HA mode.
<li/><b>Router node: </b>It is used to share the load of a master node or as the task submitter of the cluster. It can be scaled in or out at any time. Hadoop packages, including software programs and processes such as Hive, Hue, and Spark, are deployed here. The number of router nodes can be changed at any time, with a minimum value of 0.</ul></td>
