## Overview
Cluster events include event lists and event policies.
- Event list: It records key change events and abnormal events occurring in the cluster.
- Event policy: Event monitoring trigger policies can be customized based on the actual business conditions. Events with monitoring enabled can be set as cluster inspection items.

## Viewing Event List
1. Log in to the [EMR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and click the **ID/Name** of the target cluster in the cluster list to enter the cluster details page.
2. On the cluster details page, select **Cluster monitoring** > **Cluster events** > **Event list** to view all operation events in the current cluster.

The severity divides into the following:
 - Fatal: Exception events of a node or service that require manual intervention and will cause service interruption if left unattended. Such events may last for a period of time.
 - Severe: Alert events that currently have not caused service or node interruption but will cause fatal events if left unattended.
 - Moderate: Regular events occurring in the cluster that generally do not require special processing.

3. Click the value in the **Triggers today** column to view the event's trigger records, metrics, logs, and snapshots.

## Setting Event Policies
1. Log in to the [EMR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and click the **ID/Name** of the target cluster in the cluster list.
2. On the cluster details page, select **Cluster monitoring** > **Cluster events** > **Event policy** and you can customize the event monitoring trigger policies.
3. The event configuration list contains the event name, event trigger policy, severity (fatal, severe, and moderate), and option to enable/disable monitoring, which can be modified and saved.

4. Event trigger policies cover two types of events: fixed system policy events (which cannot be modified) and custom events (which can be configured based on the business standards).

5. You can select whether to enable event monitoring in an event policy. Only events with monitoring enabled can be selected as cluster inspection items. Monitoring is enabled by default for some events and is enabled by default and cannot be disabled for some other events. The following are the specific rules:
