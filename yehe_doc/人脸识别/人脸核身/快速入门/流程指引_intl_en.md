This document describes relevant operations and provides documentation links to help you better use Tencent Cloud FaceID.
## Access Process
### Step 1. Sign up and log in
Log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login). If you do not have an account yet, sign up as instructed in [Signing Up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985), and complete identity verification as instructed in [Enterprise Identity Verification Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/378/10496).

### Step 2. Apply for the service
Log in to the [FaceID console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/faceid) to activate the service.

### Step 3. Use the service
We recommend using the [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=faceid&Version=2018-03-01&Action=DetectAuth&SignVersion=) for online call, signature verification, SDK code generation, quick API search and more, which significantly reduces the difficulty in using TencentCloud API 3.0. You can use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=faceid&Version=2018-03-01&Action=DetectAuth&SignVersion=) to generate **server SDKs** and use them with the compiled Tencent Cloud SDKs to quickly call the FaceID service. The server SDKs are available in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, PHP, Go, Node.js, .NET, etc. You can download the corresponding SDK in the documentation of each service or get it from the [SDK Center](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/494).

FaceID also provides a ["Quick API Run" tutorial](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1061/37029) to help you debug and test the service.
