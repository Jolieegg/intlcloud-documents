### Wide Coverage and Nearby Service
ECM IDCs are widely distributed across regions in China and cover the networks of main ISPs such as China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. You can select a specific edge node based on your region, province, and city, create ECM modules and instances, and deploy the required services. With ECM, you can deliver a faster network experience for local users and provide more cost-effective computing and network resources for your business. 

### Secure and Reliable Cloud-Edge Collaboration
ECM is developed based on various mature and leading technical capabilities of Tencent Cloud. On one hand, it can provide on-demand basic and professional protection services for network and server security. On the other hand, it can collaborate with main Tencent Cloud services to make it easier for businesses to use relevant configurations and capabilities, giving full play to the collaboration strengths of cloud-edge computing. In addition, by combining the shared capabilities of Tencent Cloud, it allows you to manage and manipulate ECM modules and instances through the console and TencentCloud API as well as implement efficient OPS based on various monitoring metrics of CM. 

### Higher Elasticity, Flexibility, and Cost-Effectiveness
ECM is pay-as-you-go. You can flexibly adjust the module and instance scales based on the fluctuations in business requests and create and return modules and instances in several minutes. This avoids the resource waste caused by one-time large upfront investment and business fluctuation and greatly reduces the costs.
Compared with the BGP network, the non-BGP static network service provided by ECM has lower bandwidth costs and can bring more cost-effective resources to your business.
