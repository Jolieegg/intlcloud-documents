## Overview
A security group is a virtual firewall that can filter stateful data packets. As an important means for network security isolation provided by Tencent Cloud, it can be used to set network access controls for one or more ECM instances.
When creating an ECM module, you must configure the default security group for it, which will be used as the default security group configuration when you create instances in it. You can change the default security group as instructed in this document. In addition, Tencent Cloud allows you to replace the security group of an ECM instance after instance creation. For more information, see [Configuring Instance Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43430).
