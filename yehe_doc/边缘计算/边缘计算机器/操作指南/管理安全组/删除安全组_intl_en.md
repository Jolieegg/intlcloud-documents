## Overview

If you no longer need a security group, you can delete it. Once a security group is deleted, all rules within it are also deleted.

## Prerequisites

Before deleting a security group, you must remove all associated instances. Otherwise, the operation will fail. For more information, see [Removing Instance from Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43436).

3. On the **Security Group** management page, select **More** > **Delete** on the right of the security group to be deleted.
