- [What should I know before using ECM?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43409)

## 2. ECM Billing Modes
ECM has two billable items: **computing storage** and **network bandwidth**. You should comprehensively understand the billing modes to select the most appropriate configurations. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43404).

## 3. Getting Started
#### 3.1 Registering account and verifying identity
Before using ECM, you need to sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register?&s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.intl.cloud.tencent.com%2Fworkorder) and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629) first.

#### 3.2 Activating service
Go to the [ECM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ecm), click **Submit Application** to enter the application page, enter the user information, submit the application, and wait for approval. Once the application is approved, you can start using ECM.
 

#### 3.3 Creating ECM module
An ECM module is the basic module for managing the edge service. After ECM is activated, you can create a module and select configuration items such as instance type, number of CPU cores, memory, default image, and storage as needed. For more information, see [Creating ECM Module](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43421).

#### 3.4 Creating instance
After creating an ECM module, you can select configuration items such as CPU, memory, and network flexibly as needed to create instances. For more information, see [Creating Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43424).

#### 3.5 Logging in to instance
After creating an instance successfully, you can log in to it as instructed in [Logging in to Linux Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1119/43412).
