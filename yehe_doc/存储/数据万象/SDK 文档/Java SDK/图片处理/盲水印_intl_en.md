## Adding Blind Watermark

#### Feature description

You can add a blind watermark when uploading or downloading an object.

// The bucket name must contain `appid`.
// For the API description, visit https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/46782.
String bucketName = "examplebucket-1250000000";

String key = "test.png";
File localFile = new File("E://test.png");
PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, key, localFile);
PicOperations picOperations = new PicOperations();
picOperations.setIsPicInfo(1);
List<PicOperations.Rule> ruleList = new LinkedList<>();
PicOperations.Rule rule = new PicOperations.Rule();
rule.setBucket(bucketName);
rule.setFileId("test-watermark.png");
rule.setRule("watermark/3/type/3/text/dGVuY2VudCBjbG91ZA==");
ruleList.add(rule);
picOperations.setRules(ruleList);
putObjectRequest.setPicOperations(picOperations);
try {
    PutObjectResult putObjectResult = cosClient.putObject(putObjectRequest);
    CIUploadResult ciUploadResult = putObjectResult.getCiUploadResult();
    System.out.println(putObjectResult.getRequestId());
    System.out.println(ciUploadResult.getOriginalInfo().getEtag());
    for(CIObject ciObject:ciUploadResult.getProcessResults().getObjectList()) {
        System.out.println(ciObject.getLocation());
    }
} catch (CosServiceException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (CosClientException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, key, localFile);
PicOperations picOperations = new PicOperations();
picOperations.setIsPicInfo(1);
List<PicOperations.Rule> ruleList = new LinkedList<>();
PicOperations.Rule rule = new PicOperations.Rule();
rule.setBucket(bucketName);
rule.setFileId("qrcode-watermark-extract.png");
rule.setRule("watermark/4/type/2/image/aHR0cDovL2V4YW1wbGVidWNrZXQtMTI1MDAwMDAwMC5jb3MuYXAtZ3Vhbmd6aG91Lm15cWNsb3VkLmNvbS9zaHVpeWluLnBuZw==");
ruleList.add(rule);
picOperations.setRules(ruleList);
putObjectRequest.setPicOperations(picOperations);
try {
    PutObjectResult putObjectResult = cosClient.putObject(putObjectRequest);
    CIUploadResult ciUploadResult = putObjectResult.getCiUploadResult();
