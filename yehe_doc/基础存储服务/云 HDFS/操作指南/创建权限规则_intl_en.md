This document describes how to create a permission rule. A permission group contains various permission rules for management of CHDFS permissions. Before using CHDFS, you need to create a permission rule in a created permission group first.

## Prerequisites

You have created a permission group. For more information on how to create one, please see [Creating Permission Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1106/41962).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [CHDFS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/chdfs), click **Permission Groups** on the left sidebar, and select the target region, such as Guangzhou.
2. Find the target permission group and click **Add Rule** to enter the rule configuration page, where you can view the basic information of the permission group and the permission rule list. In the rule list, enter **Authorized Address**, **Access Mode**, and **Priority**.

 - Authorized Address: IP address or IP range, which is authorized to access CHDFS, such as `10.10.1.2` or `10.10.1.2/20`.
 - Access Mode: "Read-write" or "Read-only" access to CHDFS.
 - Priority: 1â€“100, where "1" represents the highest priority. When a CHDFS instance matches multiple permission rules, high-priority rules override low-priority ones.
3. Click **Save**.
