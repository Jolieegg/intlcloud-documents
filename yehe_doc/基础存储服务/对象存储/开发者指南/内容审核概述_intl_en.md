## Overview

The COS content moderation service intelligently moderates the multimedia content of images, videos, audios, text, documents, and webpages. It helps you effectively identify non-compliant content such as pornographic, vulgar, terrorist, illegal, disgusting, and offensive information to avoid operational risks. Currently, files in the following formats can be moderated:

For a file that is found to be sensitive after moderation, we recommend that you choose one of the following methods to process it:

- Move the file to the backup directory. The file is moved by copying the original file to the specified directory and then deleting the original file. For more information, see [PUT Object - Copy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10881) and [DELETE Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7743).
