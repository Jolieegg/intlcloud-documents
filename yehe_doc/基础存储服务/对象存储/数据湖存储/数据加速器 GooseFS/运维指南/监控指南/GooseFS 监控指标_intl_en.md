## Monitoring Metrics Overview

GooseFSâ€™s monitoring metrics include the running statuses of clients, clusters, masters, workers, and processes.

1. Monitoring metrics are classified into the following four types based on the statistics dimension:
 - **Gauge**: records the instantaneous values of an event. The values can be up and down and are usually used to monitor the system running status.
 - **Meter**: records event frequency (how many times an event occurs in a fixed period of time) such as the number of requests in 1, 5, or 15 minutes.
 - **Counter**: records how many times an event occurs in total. Compared with Gauge, the value will only go up but not down. It is usually used to record data such as the number of access requests.
 - **Timer**: records the frequency and distribution of an event. This metric is a combination of the Histogram and Meter metrics. Histogram is used to record the time consumption distribution, and Meter is used to record the QPS. If you need statistics on both the frequency and time consumption, you can use the Timer metric.

>!For more metric classifications, please see [Metrics Library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/getting-started). Currently, GooseFS supports only the four metrics above.

2. Monitoring metrics are classified into the following two types based on the data source:
 - **Cluster status metric**: records the monitoring data of the cluster, masters, and workers. These metrics show the running status of the entire cluster and each node. The recording format is as follows:
```plaintext
Master.[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...
[Worker_ip].[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...
```
 - **Process metric**: records the number of requests, delay, CPU consumption, and RPC calling times for the cluster. These metrics can be pushed to and displayed on a third-party monitoring tool. The recording format is as follows:
```plaintext
[processType].[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...[hostName]
```

## Cluster Monitoring Metrics

If a GooseFS cluster is deployed, clients and workers will send the monitoring data to the master periodically through the heartbeat. You can use `goosefs.master.worker.heartbeat.interval` and `goosefs.user.metrics.heartbeat.interval` to set the heartbeat interval of workers and clients, respectively.

## Process Monitoring Metrics

Process monitoring metrics are collected and aggregated from clusters, masters, and workers. Metrics are classified into JVM metrics, garbage collection metrics, and memory consumption metrics.

JVM metrics:

| **Metric** | **Description**           |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| name         | The name of the JVM    |
| uptime       | The uptime of the JVM  |
| vendor       | The current JVM vendor |

Garbage collection metrics:

| **Metric** | **Description**           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| PS-MarkSweep.count | Total number of mark and sweep  |
| PS-MarkSweep.time  | The time used to mark and sweep |
| PS-Scavenge.count  | Total number of scavenge        |
| PS-Scavenge.time   | The time used to scavenge       |

Memory consumption metrics record the overall and detailed information about memory consumption. Some metrics are listed below:

| **Metric** | **Description**           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| total.committed                   | The amount of memory in bytes that is guaranteed to be available for use by the JVM |
| total.init                        | The amount of the memory in bytes that is available for use by the JVM | 
| total.max                         | The maximum amount of memory in bytes that is available for use by the JVM | 
| total.used                        | The amount of memory currently used in bytes                 |
| heap.committed                    | The amount of memory from heap area guaranteed to be available |
| heap.init                         | The amount of memory from heap area available at initialization |
| heap.max                          | The maximum amount of memory from heap area that is available |
| heap.usage                        | The amount of memory from heap area currently used in GB     |
| heap.used                         | The amount of memory from heap area that has been used       |
| pools.Code-Cache.used             | Used memory of collection usage from the pool from which memory is used for compilation and storage of native code |
| pools.Compressed-Class-Space.used | Used memory of collection usage from the pool from which memory is used for class metadata |
| pools.PS-Eden-Space.used          | Used memory of collection usage from the pool from which memory is initially allocated for most objects |
| pools.PS-Survivor-Space.used      | Used memory of collection usage from the pool containing objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden spac |
