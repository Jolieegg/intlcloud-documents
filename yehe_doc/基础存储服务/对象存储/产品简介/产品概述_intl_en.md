## Concepts

This section describes key concepts that help you better understand COS.

- [Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312): A container for objects stored in COS. Each bucket can store an unlimited number of objects.
- [Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324): The basic unit of COS storage. It can be data in any format, such as image, document, audio, and video.
- [Region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A physical location where data centers are hosted in Tencent Cloud. COS data is stored in the buckets in these regions.
- [Endpoint](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A COS endpoint used to access and download an object stored in a bucket.
- [Storage class](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925): A storage level that indicates how active objects are in COS. COS offers multiple storage classes, including MAZ_STANDARD, MAZ_STANDARD_IA, MAZ_INTELLIGENT TIERING, STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, INTELLIGENT TIERING, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. Different storage classes are suitable for different use cases and have different attributes, such as object access frequency and access latency.
