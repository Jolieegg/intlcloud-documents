## Overview

This document provides an overview of APIs and SDK code samples related to object deletion.

| API | Operation | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [DELETE Object](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/7743) | Deleting a single object | Deletes a specified object from a bucket |
| [DELETE Multiple Objects](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/8289) | Deleting multiple objects | Deletes multiple objects in a single request |


## Deleting a Single Object

#### Feature description

This API is used to delete a specified object.

#### Method prototype

```
delete_object(Bucket, Key, **kwargs)
```
#### Sample 1. Deleting an object

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
import sys
import os
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print information about the communication with the server.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = os.environ['COS_SECRET_ID']     #  User `SecretId`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/598/32675.
secret_key = os.environ['COS_SECRET_KEY']   # User `SecretKey`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/598/32675.
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket.
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/6224.
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/14048.
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default.

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

response = client.delete_object(
    Bucket='examplebucket-1250000000',
    Key='exampleobject'
)
```

#### Sample 2. Deleting a directory

In COS, a directory is a special object with a path ending in "/". You can directly call the `Delete Object` API to delete a directory. Note that only empty directories can be deleted. If you want to delete non-empty directories, see "Deleting objects with a specified prefix".

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
import sys
import os
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print information about the communication with the server.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = os.environ['COS_SECRET_ID']     #  User `SecretId`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/598/32675.
secret_key = os.environ['COS_SECRET_KEY']   # User `SecretKey`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/598/32675.
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket.
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/6224.
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/14048.
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default.

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

to_delete_dir='path/to/delete/dir/'
response = client.delete_object(
    Bucket='examplebucket-1250000000',
    Key=to_delete_dir,
)
print(response)
```

#### Sample 3: Deleting objects with a specified prefix

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = os.environ['COS_SECRET_ID']     #  User `SecretId`. We recommend you use a sub-account key and follow the principle of least privilege to reduce risks. For information about how to obtain a sub-account key, visit https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/598/32675.

scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default.

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

# Delete objects with the specified prefix.
bucket = 'examplebucket-1250000000'
is_over = False
marker = ''
prefix = 'root/logs'
while not is_over:
    response = client.list_objects(Bucket=bucket, Prefix=prefix, Marker=marker)
    if 'Contents' in response:
        for content in response['Contents']:
            print("delete object: ", content['Key'])
            client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=content['Key'])

        if response['IsTruncated'] == 'false':
            is_over = True
            marker = response['Marker']
```

## Deleting Multiple Objects (Deleting a Directory)

#### Feature description
COS does not have the concept of directories, but you can use slashes (/) as the delimiter to simulate directories.

In COS, deleting a directory and the objects contained actually means deleting objects that have the same specified prefix. Currently, COSâ€™s Python SDK does not provide a standalone API to perform this operation. However, you can still do so with a combination of basic operations (query object list + batch delete objects).

#### Sample request
```python
# -*- coding=utf-8

            file_infos.extend(contents)

        # Quit after the listing.
        if response['IsTruncated'] == 'false':
            break
        
        # Get the next response.
        marker = response["NextMarker"]

    pool.wait_completion()
    return None
