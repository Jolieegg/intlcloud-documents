## Simple Operations

### Uploading object by using simple upload

#### Feature description

This API (`PUT Object`) is used to upload an object to a bucket. To call this API, you must have write access to the bucket.

> !
> - The key (filename) cannot end with `/`; otherwise, it will be identified as a folder.
> - The uploaded file will overwrite the existing file in the cloud with the same key (filename). If you don't want to overwrite the existing file when versioning is not enabled, make sure that the uploaded file has a different key.
> - Each root account (`APPID`) can have up to 1,000 bucket ACLs and an unlimited number of object ACLs. Do not configure ACLs for an object during upload if you don't need to control the access to it, in which case the object will inherit the permissions of its bucket by default.
> - After an object is uploaded, you can use the same key to generate a pre-signed URL, which can be shared with other clients for downloading. To download the object, use the `GET` method. The detailed API description is as follows. If your file is set to private-read, note that the pre-signed URL will only be valid for a certain period of time.
> - The upload progress `onProgress` depends on the native `xhr.upload.onprogress` method. If you find that the upload progress is inaccurate, check whether a library (such as nuysoft/Mock) that intercepts XHR methods is referenced in your project.
> 

#### Sample code

Upload a small file:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object)
```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: '1.jpg',  /* Object key stored in the bucket (required), such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt`. */
    Body: fileObject, /* The file object to be uploaded (required). It can be the file object obtained after the `input[type="file"]` tag is used to select a local file. */
    onProgress: function(progressData) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Upload a string as the file content:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-string)
```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */

    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Upload a Base64-encoded string as the file content:

```js
var base64Url = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo.....';
var dataURLtoBlob = function (dataurl) {
    var arr = dataurl.split(',');
    var mime = arr[0].match(/:(.*?);/)[1];
    var bstr = atob(arr[1]);
    var n = bstr.length;
    var u8arr = new Uint8Array(n);
    while (n--) {
        u8arr[n] = bstr.charCodeAt(n);
    }
    return new Blob([u8arr], { type: mime });
};
// Convert to BLOB for upload

### Appending parts

#### Feature description

This API (`APPEND Object`) is used to upload an object to a bucket by appending parts.

> !
> - The COS JavaScript SDK version must be at least v1.3.1.
> - This API can append data only to appendable objects.
> - If an object is uploaded by using the `APPEND Object` API for the first time, it will be automatically determined as "appendable".
> - You can use the `GET Object` or `HEAD Object` API to get the `x-cos-object-type` response header to determine the object type.
> 

#### Sample code

Append parts for the first time:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.appendObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: 'test.txt',  /* Object key stored in the bucket, such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt` (required) */
    Body: fileObject, /* The file object to be uploaded (required). It can be the file object obtained after the `input[type="file"]` tag is used to select a local file. */
    Position: 0, // The value is `0` for the first upload.
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Check whether parts can be appended to an object in a bucket:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.headObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: 'test.txt',  /* Object key stored in the bucket, such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt` (required) */
}, function(err, data) {
    if (err) return console.log(err);
    // If `data.headers` does not contain the `x-cos-object-type` field, you need to configure `expose-headers`. For more information, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13318.
    var objectType = data.headers['x-cos-object-type'];
    console.log(objectType === 'appendable');
});
```

Query the position of the object for parts appending and start upload:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.headObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: 'test.txt',  /* Object key stored in the bucket, such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt` (required) */
}, function(err, data) {
    if (err) return console.log(err);
    // Get the current length (position for upload) of the file to be appended
    var position = data.headers['content-length'];
    cos.appendObject({
        Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
        Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
        Key: 'test.txt',  /* Object key stored in the bucket, such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt` (required) */
        Body: '66666',
        Position: position,
    },
    function(err, data) {
        if (err) return console.log(err);
        // Get the position for the next upload and continue appending parts
        // If `data.headers` does not contain the `x-cos-next-append-position` field, you need to configure `expose-headers`. For more information, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13318.
        var nextPosition = data.headers['x-cos-next-append-position'];
        console.log(nextPosition);
    })
});
```

### Uploading object by using HTML form

The JavaScript SDK does not provide a method for the `POST Object` API. If you need to use this API, see "Solution B: Upload with a form" in [Practice of Direct Transfer for Web End](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/9067).


## Multipart Operations

>?Generally, you don't need to care about these methods. `sliceUploadFile` has encapsulated the following multipart operations, which can be called directly. We recommend you use the advanced upload method `uploadFile`.

### Querying multipart uploads

#### Feature description

This API (`List Multipart Uploads`) is used to query ongoing multipart uploads. Up to 1,000 multipart uploads can be listed at a time.

#### Sample code

Get the list of incomplete multipart uploads with `UploadId` prefixed with `a`:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-list-multi-upload)
```js
cos.multipartList({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
    Prefix: 'a',                        /* Optional */
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

### Uploading parts

#### Feature description

This API (`Upload Part`) is used to upload parts after a multipart upload is initialized. It can upload 1â€“10,000 parts of 1 MBâ€“5 GB at a time.
- After calling the `Initiate Multipart Upload` API to initialize a multipart upload, you will get an `uploadId`. This ID uniquely identifies the part and marks its position in the object.
- Every time you call the `Upload Part` API, you need to pass in `partNumber` (the part number) and `uploadId`. You can upload multiple parts out of order.
- If the `uploadId` and `partNumber` of a new part are the same as those of a previously uploaded part, the old part will be overwritten. If the `uploadId` does not exist, `404` (NoSuchUpload) will be returned.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-upload-part)
```js
cos.multipartUpload({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */

### Completing multipart upload

#### Feature description

This API (`Complete Multipart Upload`) is used to complete a multipart upload. After all parts are uploaded via the `Upload Parts` API, you need to call this API to complete the multipart upload. When using this API, you need to specify the `PartNumber` and `ETag` of each part in the request body for the part information to be verified.
The parts need to be reassembled after they are uploaded, which takes several minutes. When the assembly starts, COS will immediately return the status code `200` and will periodically return spaces during the process to keep the connection active until the assembly is completed. After that, COS will return the assembled result in the body.

- If the uploaded part size is below 1 MB, `400 EntityTooSmall` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the uploaded part numbers are not continuous, `400 InvalidPart` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the part information entries in the request body are not sorted by number in ascending order, `400 InvalidPartOrder` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the `UploadId` does not exist, `404 NoSuchUpload` will be returned when this API is called.

>! We recommend you either complete or abort a multipart upload as early as possible, as the uploaded parts of an incomplete multipart upload will take up storage capacity and incur storage fees.

### Aborting multipart upload

#### Feature description

This API (`Abort Multipart Upload`) is used to abort a multipart upload and delete the uploaded parts. If you call this API and there is an ongoing upload request with the specified `UploadId`, the upload request will fail. If the `uploadId` does not exist, `404` (NoSuchUpload) will be returned.

>! We recommend you either complete or abort a multipart upload as early as possible, as the uploaded parts of an incomplete multipart upload will take up storage capacity and incur storage fees.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-abort-multi-upload)
```js
cos.multipartAbort({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: '1.jpg',  /* Object key stored in the bucket (required), such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt`. */
    UploadId: 'exampleUploadId'    /* Required */
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});

```

#### Parameter description

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| Bucket | Bucket name in the format of `BucketName-APPID`. | String  | Yes   |
| Region  | Bucket region. For the enumerated values, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224). | String | Yes |
| Key     | Object key (object name), which is the unique identifier of an object in a bucket. For more information, see [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324). | String | Yes |
| UploadId | Multipart upload ID, which is obtained from the response of the `Initiate Multipart Upload` API. | String | Yes |

#### Callback function description

```
function(err, data) { ... }
```

| Parameter  | Description                                               | Type             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| err    | The object returned when an error (network error or service error) occurs. If the request is successful, this parameter is empty. For more information, see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7730). | Object |
| - statusCode | Returned HTTP status code, such as `200`, `403`, and `404`. | Number |
| - headers | Returned headers | Object |
| data         | The object returned when the request is successful. If an error occurs with the request, this parameter is empty.               | Object |

| - headers | Returned headers | Object |


## Advanced APIs (Recommended)

We strongly recommend you use advanced APIs, which encapsulate the native methods mentioned above. They can implement the complete process of multipart upload and support concurrent multipart upload, checkpoint restart, as well as canceling, pausing, and resuming upload tasks.

### Advanced upload

#### Feature description
This API (`Upload File`) is used to implement an advanced upload. You can use the `SliceSize` parameter to specify a file size threshold (1 MB by default). If a file is larger than this threshold, it will be uploaded in parts (sliceUploadFile); otherwise, it will be uploaded in whole (putObject).
#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-file)
```js
cos.uploadFile({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
    Key: '1.jpg',  /* Object key stored in the bucket (required), such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt`. */
    Body: fileObject, /* The file object to be uploaded (required). It can be the file object obtained after the `input[type="file"]` tag is used to select a local file. */
    SliceSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5,     /* The threshold (5 MB in this example) to trigger multipart upload (optional) */
    onTaskReady: function(taskId) {                   /* Optional */
        console.log(taskId);
    },
    onProgress: function (progressData) {           /* Optional */
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    },
    onFileFinish: function (err, data, options) {   /* Optional */
       console.log(options.Key + 'upload' + (err ? 'failed' : 'completed'));
    },
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

### Uploading object by using multipart upload (checkpoint restart)

#### Feature description

This API (`Slice Upload File`) is used to upload a large file in parts.

>?
>- If the browser is not closed, you can pause, resume, or cancel the upload.
>- If you upload the same file to the same bucket path after refreshing the browser, the file content will be verified based on `UploadId`, and the upload will resume from where left off if the verification is passed.

### Batch upload

#### Feature description

Option 1:
You can call `putObject` or `sliceUploadFile` multiple times to implement batch uploads. Instantiate the `FileParallelLimit` parameter to limit the maximum number of concurrently uploaded files allowed, which is 3 by default.

Option 2:
You can call `cos.uploadFiles` to implement batch uploads. The `SliceSize` parameter can be used to control the file. The following describes how to use the `uploadFiles` method:

#### Method prototype

Call `uploadFiles`:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-batch-upload-objects)
```js
cos.uploadFiles({

        Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
        Key: '1.jpg',  /* Object key stored in the bucket (required), such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt`. */
        Body: fileObject1, /* The file object to be uploaded (required). It can be the file object obtained after the `input[type="file"]` tag is used to select a local file. */
        onTaskReady: function(taskId) {
          /* Based on `taskId`, you can use queue operations to cancel (`cos.cancelTask(taskId)`), pause (`cos.pauseTask(taskId)`), or resume (`cos.restartTask(taskId)`) the upload. */
          console.log(taskId);
        }
    }, {
        Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Your bucket (required) */
        Region: 'COS_REGION',  /* Bucket region (required), such as ap-beijing */
        Key: '2.jpg',  /* Object key stored in the bucket (required), such as `1.jpg` and `a/b/test.txt`. */
        Body: fileObject2, /* The file object to be uploaded (required). It can be the file object obtained after the `input[type="file"]` tag is used to select a local file. */
        onTaskReady: function(taskId) {
        /* Based on `taskId`, you can use queue operations to cancel (`cos.cancelTask(taskId)`), pause (`cos.pauseTask(taskId)`), or resume (`cos.restartTask(taskId)`) the upload. */
        console.log(taskId);
      }
    }],
    SliceSize: 1024 * 1024 * 10,    /* Set the file size threshold to trigger a multipart upload to 10 MB. */
    onProgress: function (info) {
        var percent = parseInt(info.percent * 10000) / 100;
        var speed = parseInt(info.speed / 1024 / 1024 * 100) / 100;
        console.log('progress:' + percent + '%; speed:' + speed + 'Mb/s;');
    },
    onFileFinish: function (err, data, options) {
        console.log(options.Key + 'upload' + (err ? 'failed' : 'completed'));

### Upload queue

The JavaScript SDK records all the `putObject` and `sliceUploadFile` upload tasks in a queue. Relevant queue operations are as follows:

1. Use `var taskList = cos.getTaskList()` to get the task list.
2. Use `cos.pauseTask()`, `cos.restartTask()`, or `cos.cancelTask()` to manage the task.
3. Use `cos.on('list-update', callback);` to listen for list and progress changes.

For detailed instructions on how to use the upload queue, see the queue demo at [GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-js-sdk-v5/tree/master/demo/queue).

#### Canceling upload task

This API is used to cancel an upload task by `taskId`.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-cancel)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.cancelTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | ID of the upload task. When `sliceUploadFile` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback. | String | Yes |

#### Pausing upload task

This API is used to pause an upload task by `taskId`.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-pause)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.pauseTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | ID of the upload task. When `sliceUploadFile` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback. | String | Yes |

#### Resuming upload task

This API is used to resume an upload task by `taskId`. You can resume tasks that have been manually paused through the `pauseTask` API or automatically paused due to an upload error.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-resume)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.restartTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

<table>
	<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th></tr>
	<tr><td>taskId</td><td>ID of the upload task. When `sliceUploadFile` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback.</td><td>String</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</table>
