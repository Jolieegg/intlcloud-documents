## Single Image Moderation

#### Feature description

The existing data scan feature of image moderation leverages CI's persistent processing API to scan existing data stored in COS for pornographic, illegal, and advertising images.

#### Method prototype

```java
ImageAuditingResponse imageAuditing(ImageAuditingRequest request);
```


#### Sample request

```java
//1. Create a job request object
ImageAuditingRequest request = new ImageAuditingRequest();
//2. Add request parameters as detailed in the API documentation
//2.1 Set the request bucket
request.setBucketName("examplebucket-1250000000");
//2.2 Set the moderation type
request.setDetectType("porn,ads");
//2.3 Set the image location in the bucket
request.setObjectKey("1.png");
//3. Call the API to get the job response object
ImageAuditingResponse response = client.imageAuditing(request);
```


#### Parameter description

`Request` has the following sub-nodes:

| Node Name (Keyword) | Description | Type | Required |
| ------------------ |-------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---- |
| ObjectKey          | Name of the image file in the COS bucket. The COS bucket is specified by `Host`. For example, if the file is `img.jpg` in the `test` directory in the `examplebucket-1250000000` bucket in Beijing, then `Host` is `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com`, and `ObjectKey` is `test/img.jpg`. | String | No |
| bizType           | Unique identifier of the moderation policy. You can configure the scenes you want to moderate on the moderation policy page in the console, such as pornographic, adverting, and illegal information. For configuration guidelines, see [Setting Moderation Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/52095). You can get `bizType` in the console. If `bizType` is specified, the moderation request will perform moderation based on the scenes configured in the moderation policy. If `bizType` is not specified, the default moderation policy will be used automatically. | String | No       |
| detectType        | The scene to be moderated, such as `Porn` (pornography) and `Ads` (advertising). This parameter will no longer be maintained in the future. You can pass in multiple types and separate them by comma, such as `Porn,Ads`. If you need to moderate more scenes, use the `bizType` parameter. | String | No       |
| detectUrl         | You can enter a `detectUrl` value to moderate an image accessible over the public network. If `detectUrl` is not specified, the backend will moderate by `ObjectKey` by default. If `detectUrl` is specified, the backend will moderate by `detectUrl`, and there will be no need to enter `ObjectKey`. Sample `detectUrl`: `http://www.example.com/abc.jpg`. | String | No       |
| interval           | For GIF image moderation, you can use this parameter to configure the frame capturing interval. The default value is `5`, indicating to capture a frame every five frames starting from the first frame (included). | Int | No |
| maxFrames         | The maximum number of frames to be captured for GIF image moderation, which must be greater than 0. The default value is `5`, indicating to capture five frames at most. | Int | No |
| largeImageDetect | Whether to compress the image that exceeds the size limit before moderation. Valid values: `0` (no), `1` (yes). Default value: `0`. Note: Images up to 32 MB in size can be compressed, and image compression fees will be charged. For large animated images such as GIF, the compression time is long, which may cause the moderation to fail due to timeout. | Int | No |
| dataId | Image ID. This field will return the original content in the result, which can contain up to 512 bytes. | String | No |
| async | Whether to moderate asynchronously. Valid values: `0` (returns the result synchronously); `1` (moderates asynchronously). Default value: `0`.  | Int    | No       |
| callback | The moderation result (in `Detail` mode) can be sent to your callback address in the form of a callback. This parameter takes effect for async moderation. Addresses starting with `http://` or `https://` are supported, such as  `http://www.callback.com`.  | String | No |


#### Response description

- Success: An `ImageAuditingResponse` instance is returned upon success, which contains the moderation result.
- Failure: An error (such as the bucket does not exist) occurs, reporting the `CosClientException` or `CosServiceException` exception. For more information, see [Troubleshooting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31537).
