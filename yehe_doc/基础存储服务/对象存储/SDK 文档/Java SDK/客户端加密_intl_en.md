## Overview

The Java SDK supports client-side encryption. Files can be encrypted before the upload and decrypted during the download. Client-side encryption is suitable for users who store sensitive data.

The following two types of keys are supported for client-side encryption:
- KMS managed keys: You can provide the ID of your KMS CMK to the SDK. To use this type of keys, the KMS service needs to be activated. For more information, please see [Key Management Service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030).
- Customer managed keys: This type of keys (AES symmetric or RSA asymmetric) is provided and managed by you.
>? Symmetric or asymmetric keys mentioned above are to encrypt the randomly generated keys only. Note that files are always encrypted symmetrically using AES-256.
>

## Notes

- User data will not be uploaded to COS unless it is encrypted.
- Client-side encryption may affect the upload speed.
- The SDK uses the serial mode for multipart upload.

## Preparations

The client uses AES-256 internally to encrypt data. By default, earlier versions of JDK6-JDK8 do not support 256-bit encryption. If run, the exception `java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters` will be reported. In this case, we need to supplement Oracle's JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files and deploy them in the JRE environment. Please download the corresponding files according to the JDK version used, and decompress and save them in the `jre/lib/security` directory under `JAVA_HOME`.

- [JDK6 JCE supplementary package](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html)
- [JDK7 JCE supplementary package](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
- [JDK8 JCE supplementary package](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

## Encryption upon Upload

1. Before each object upload, a symmetric key will be generated randomly and encrypted with the KMS/customer managed key. The encrypted result will then be Base64-encoded and stored in the object metadata.
2. During the upload, the file is encrypted in memory using the AES256 algorithm.

## Decryption upon Download

1. Get the necessary encryption information from the metadata of the file, Base64-decode it, and then decrypt it using the KMS or customer managed key to get the encryption key at upload.
2. Use the resulting key to decrypt the downloaded input stream using AES256.

#### Sample 1
The following sample uses Tencent Cloudâ€²s KMS service for client-side encryption. For the complete sample code, please see [Complete Sample of Client-Side Encryption using KMS](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-java-sdk-v5/blob/master/src/main/java/com/qcloud/cos/demo/KMSEncryptionClientDemo.java).
