## Querying a Bucket List

#### Description

This API (GET Service (List Buckets)) is used to query the list of all buckets under a specified account.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-get-service)
```java
GetServiceRequest getServiceRequest = new GetServiceRequest();
cosXmlService.getServiceAsync(getServiceRequest, new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        GetServiceResult getServiceResult = (GetServiceResult) result;
    }

    // If you use the Kotlin language to call this, please note that the exception in the callback method is nullable; otherwise, the onFail method will not be called back, that is:
    // clientException is of type CosXmlClientException? and serviceException is of type CosXmlServiceException?
    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest cosXmlRequest,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```

## Creating a Bucket

#### Description

This API (PUT Bucket) is used to create a bucket.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-bucket)
```java
// Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID (APPID is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
String bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
PutBucketRequest putBucketRequest = new PutBucketRequest(bucket);
cosXmlService.putBucketAsync(putBucketRequest, new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        PutBucketResult putBucketResult = (PutBucketResult) result;
    }

    // If you use the Kotlin language to call this, please note that the exception in the callback method is nullable; otherwise, the onFail method will not be called back, that is:
    // clientException is of type CosXmlClientException? and serviceException is of type CosXmlServiceException?
    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest cosXmlRequest,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```

## Checking a Bucket and Its Permissions

#### Description

This API is used to verify whether a bucket exists and whether you have permission to access it.

- If the bucket exists and you have permission to read it, HTTP status code 200 will be returned.
- If you do not have permission to read the bucket, HTTP status code 403 will be returned.
- If the bucket does not exist, HTTP status code 404 will be returned.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-head-bucket)
```java
// Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID (APPID is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
String bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
HeadBucketRequest headBucketRequest = new HeadBucketRequest(bucket);
cosXmlService.headBucketAsync(headBucketRequest, new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        HeadBucketResult headBucketResult = (HeadBucketResult) result;
    }

    // If you use the Kotlin language to call this, please note that the exception in the callback method is nullable; otherwise, the onFail method will not be called back, that is:
    // clientException is of type CosXmlClientException? and serviceException is of type CosXmlServiceException?
    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest cosXmlRequest,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```

## Deleting a Bucket

#### Description

This API is used to delete a specified bucket.

>! Before deleting a bucket, please make sure that all the data and incomplete multipart uploads in the bucket have been deleted; otherwise, the bucket cannot be deleted.

#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-delete-bucket)
```java
// Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID (APPID is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
String bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
DeleteBucketRequest deleteBucketRequest = new DeleteBucketRequest(bucket);
cosXmlService.deleteBucketAsync(deleteBucketRequest,
        new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        DeleteBucketResult deleteBucketResult = (DeleteBucketResult) result;
    }

    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest cosXmlRequest,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```
