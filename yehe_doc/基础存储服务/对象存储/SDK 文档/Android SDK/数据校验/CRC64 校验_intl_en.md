## Overview

Errors may occur when data is transferred between the client and the server. COS can not only verify data integrity through [MD5 and custom attributes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32467), but also the CRC64 check code.

COS will calculate the CRC64 value of the newly uploaded object and store the result as object attributes. It will carry x-cos-hash-crc64ecma in the returned response header, which indicates the CRC64 value of the uploaded object calculated according to [ECMA-182 standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-182.htm). If an object already has a CRC64 value stored before this feature is activated, COS will not calculate its CRC64 value, nor will it be returned when the object is obtained.

## Description

APIs that currently support CRC64 include:

- APIs for simple upload
	- [PUT Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7749) and [POST Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14690): you can get the CRC64 check value for your file from the response header.
- Multipart upload APIs
	- [Upload Part](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7750): you can compare and verify the CRC64 value returned by COS against the value calculated locally.
	- [Complete Multipart Upload](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7742): returns a CRC64 value for the entire object only if each part has a CRC64 attribute. Otherwise, no value is returned.
- The [Upload Part - Copy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8287) operation returns a corresponding CRC64 value.
- When you call the [PUT Object - Copy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10881), the CRC64 value is returned only if the source object has one.
- The [HEAD Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7745) and [GET Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7753) operations return the CRC64 value provided the object has one. You can compare and verify the CRC64 value returned by COS against that calculated locally.

## SDK API References

For the parameters and method descriptions of all the APIs in the SDK, see [SDK API Reference](https://cos-android-sdk-doc-1253960454.file.myqcloud.com/).

## SDK Description

You can get the CRC64 value from the response header after a successful upload or download.

>! The COS Android SDK version should not be earlier than v5.7.5.

### Upload request sample
[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-upload-verify-crc64)
```java
// 1. Initialize TransferService. You should use the same TransferService for the same configuration
TransferConfig transferConfig = new TransferConfig.Builder()
        .build();
TransferService transferService = new TransferService(cosXmlService, transferConfig);

// 2. Initialize PutObjectRequest
// Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID (APPID is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
String bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
String cosPath = "exampleobject"; // Location identifier of the object in the bucket, i.e., the object key
String srcPath = "examplefilepath"; // Absolute path to the local file
PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = new PutObjectRequest(bucket,
        cosPath, srcPath);

// 3. Call the upload method to upload the file
final COSUploadTask uploadTask = transferService.upload(putObjectRequest);
uploadTask.setCosXmlResultListener(new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        // You can get the CRC64 value of the file after the upload is successful
        String crc64 = result.getHeader("x-cos-hash-crc64ecma");
    }

    // If you use the Kotlin language to call this, please note that the exception in the callback method is nullable; otherwise, the onFail method will not be called back, that is:
    // clientException is of type CosXmlClientException? and serviceException is of type CosXmlServiceException?
    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest request,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```

#### Samples for download requests
[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-download-verify-crc64)
```java
// 1. Initialize TransferService. You should use the same TransferService for the same configuration
TransferConfig transferConfig = new TransferConfig.Builder()
        .build();
TransferService transferService = new TransferService(cosXmlService, transferConfig);

// 2. Initialize GetObjectRequest
// Bucket name in the format of BucketName-APPID (APPID is required), which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
String bucket = "examplebucket-1250000000";
String cosPath = "exampleobject"; // Location identifier of the object in the bucket, i.e., the object key
String savePathDir = context.getCacheDir().toString(); // Local directory path
// File name saved locally. If not specified (null), it will be the same as the COS file name
String savedFileName = "exampleobject";
GetObjectRequest getObjectRequest = new GetObjectRequest(bucket,
        cosPath, savePathDir, savedFileName);

// 3. Call the download method to download the file
final COSDownloadTask downloadTask = transferService.download(getObjectRequest);
downloadTask.setCosXmlResultListener(new CosXmlResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(CosXmlRequest request, CosXmlResult result) {
        // You can get the CRC64 value of the file after the download is successful
        String cosCRC64 = result.getHeader("x-cos-hash-crc64ecma");
    }

    // If you use the Kotlin language to call this, please note that the exception in the callback method is nullable; otherwise, the onFail method will not be called back, that is:
    // clientException is of type CosXmlClientException? and serviceException is of type CosXmlServiceException?
    @Override
    public void onFail(CosXmlRequest request,
                       @Nullable CosXmlClientException clientException,
                       @Nullable CosXmlServiceException serviceException) {
        if (clientException != null) {
            clientException.printStackTrace();
        } else {
            serviceException.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
});
```

#### CRC64 check

When you use `TransferService` for upload or download, the SDK verifies the data by default. If you still want to perform CRC64 check yourself, refer to the following code.

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-self-verify-crc64)
```java
// 1. Refer to the above upload or download request sample code to get the CRC64 value of the file on COS
String cosCRC64 = "examplecoscrc64";

// 2. Calculate the CRC64 value of the local file
File localFile = new File("examplefilepath");
String localCRC64 = DigestUtils.getCRC64String(localFile);

// 3. Check whether localCRC64 and cosCRC64 are the same
if (localCRC64.equals(cosCRC64)) {
    // CRC64 values are the same
}
```
