## Overview

This document provides an overview of APIs and SDK code samples for creating a bucket.

>!
> - We recommend you use a temporary key as instructed in [Generating and Using Temporary Keys](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048) to call the SDK for security purposes. When you apply for a temporary key, follow the [Notes on Principle of Least Privilege](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32972) to avoid leaking resources besides your buckets and objects.
> - If you must use a permanent key, we recommend you follow the [Notes on Principle of Least Privilege](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/32972) to limit the scope of permission on the permanent key.


| API | Operation |  Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| [PUT Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7738) | Creating a bucket | Creates a bucket under a specified account |


## Creating a Bucket

#### Feature description

This API is used to create a bucket under the specified account. You can create multiple buckets under the same user account. The maximum number is 200 (regardless of region). There is no limit to the number of objects in the bucket. Bucket creation is a low-frequency operation. We recommended you create a bucket in the console and perform object operations in the SDK.

#### Method prototype

```php
public Guzzle\Service\Resource\Model createBucket(array $args = array());
```

#### Sample request

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-bucket)

```php
<?php

require dirname(__FILE__) . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$secretId = "SECRETID"; //Replace it with the actual `SecretId`, which can be viewed and managed in the CAM console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
$secretKey = "SECRETKEY"; //Replace it with the actual `SecretKey`, which can be viewed and managed in the CAM console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
$region = "ap-beijing"; //Replace it with the actual `region`, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
$cosClient = new Qcloud\Cos\Client(
    array(
        'region' => $region,
        'schema' => 'https', //Protocol header, which is http by default
        'credentials'=> array(
            'secretId'  => $secretId ,
            'secretKey' => $secretKey)));
            
try {
    $result = $cosClient->createBucket(array(
        'Bucket' => 'examplebucket-125000000' // Bucket name in the format of `BucketName-APPID`, which can be viewed in the COS console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
    ));
    // Request succeeded
    print_r($result);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Request failed
    echo($e);
}
```
