>? A previously purchased resource pack whose price has changed (for example, price reduction) can no longer be **renewed**, and you need to purchase a new one.
> 

COS allows you to renew resource packs. If a resource pack will expire soon, you can manually or automatically renew it to extend its validity period.


## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Resource Packs** > **Purchased** to enter the purchased resource pack page.
3. Select one or multiple purchased resource packs and click **Batch renew** or **Batch auto-renew**.
 - If you select **Batch renew**, select the **renewal duration** in the pop-up window, click **Renew**, and make the payment as prompted.
>? For example, if you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of **50 GB with a validity period of three months** and manually renewed it for three months, then its validity period would be extended by three months, during which you would get monthly traffic of 50 GB.
>
 - If you select **Batch auto-renew**, your resource packs will be automatically renewed on the date of expiration.
>?
> - If vouchers are available under your account, they will be first applied when your resource packs are automatically renewed.
> - Expired resource packs will not be automatically renewed and will be displayed on the **Expired** tab.
> - If you cancel auto-renewal for your resource packs, we will resume the notify-before-expiration practice for them.

## Renewal Reminder

COS supports renewal reminders for resource packs. If a resource pack will expire soon, the system will send a renewal reminder to you, and then you can promptly renew it.

- For resource packs not set to auto-renewal, an expiration reminder will be sent to you generally seven days before expiration or on the day of expiration.
- For resource packs set to auto-renewal:
 - During seven days before the date of expiration, the system will monitor the available balance in your account every day. If the balance is insufficient to renew your resource pack configured to be automatically renewed, you will be notified of the insufficient balance and advised to top up your account.
 - If the available balance in your account is sufficient on the day of expiration, the system will renew your resource pack set to auto-renewal and notify you that the resource pack is automatically renewed successfully. If the balance is insufficient, the resource pack that will first expire will be first renewed, resource packs not renewed will be processed as expired, and you will be notified that the resource packs failed to be automatically renewed and have expired due to the insufficient available balance in your account.
