 - Order type: **Purchase** or **Renew**.
 - Usage: The resource pack has not been used.
 - Validity period: The resource pack is within the validity period if purchased or has not taken effect if renewed.

>- If the policy of the campaign where the resource pack was purchased conflicts with the refund policy, the former shall prevail.

### Method for calculation of the refunded amount

Refunded amount = paid amount - (used duration/total duration) * original order price * applicable discount

>?
> - The used duration is the period of time from purchase to refunding. A used duration less than one day will be calculated as one day.
> - The original order price is calculated based on the specification, purchase duration, and pay-as-you-go unit price.
> - The applicable discount is subject to factors such as the duration the resource has been used and the discount offered to you.

### Calculation example for a self-service refund

Assume that you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 50 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of six months on the COS resource pack purchase page for 3.46 USD in cash, with no vouchers available. On the day of purchase, the resource pack was not used and was eligible for a self-service refund, and you requested a self-service refund. Then, the method for calculation of the refunded amount is analyzed as follows:

- The original order price is 50 GB * 6 months * 0.024 USD/GB/month = 7.2 USD.
- A used duration less than one day will be calculated as one day.

Refunded amount = 3.46 - (1/180) Ã— 7.2 = 3.42 USD.
