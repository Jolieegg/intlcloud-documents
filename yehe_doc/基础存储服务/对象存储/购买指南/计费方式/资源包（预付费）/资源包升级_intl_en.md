To upgrade a traffic pack or request pack, you need to purchase a new one at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=). Multiple traffic packs or request packs can be used together.

COS allows you to upgrade a resource pack. If the specification of an existing resource pack no longer meets your actual business needs, click **Upgrade** to upgrade the specification.

The upgrade steps are as follows:
1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Resource Packs** to enter the resource pack management page.
3. Select an existing resource pack and click **Upgrade**.
4. In the pop-up window, select the new **specification**, click **Upgrade**, and make the payment as prompted.
