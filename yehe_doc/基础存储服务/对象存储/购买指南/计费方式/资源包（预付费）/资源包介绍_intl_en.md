Resource packs (prepaid) are discounted packs offered by COS for different billable items. You can purchase different resource packs for deduction of the usage of billable items such as storage, requests, and traffic. Compared with pay-as-you-go billing, resource packs are cheaper and available only in public cloud regions (not in finance cloud regions), and you can choose to purchase them on your own.

This document describes resource packs (prepaid). A resource pack consists of one or multiple billable items. Compared with pay-as-you-go billing, resource packs are cheaper. Currently, available types of resource packs cover most billable items of COS, and you can purchase them based on your business needs.

## Resource Pack Classifications

Resource packs are classified into resource packs for regions in the Chinese mainland and resource packs for regions outside the Chinese mainland by region.

- Resource packs for regions in the Chinese mainland are available in public cloud regions in the Chinese mainland, not in finance cloud regions.
- Resource packs for regions outside the Chinese mainland apply to regions outside the Chinese mainland.

The following table classifies resource packs by type:

> ?
> - For more information on the billable items as described in the table, see [Billable Items](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40096).
> - When a resource pack is used up or expires, the billing mode will be automatically switched to pay-as-you-go billing. To avoid incurring additional fees, we recommend that you promptly upgrade or renew the resource pack.

|   Resource Pack Type      |  Resource Pack Description                   | Resource Pack Deduction Rules   |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |--------|
| Storage pack     | The following types of storage packs are available:<br><li>STANDARD storage pack: Applies to deduction of STANDARD storage usage, not to deduction of MAZ_STANDARD storage usage.<br><li>STANDARD_IA storage pack: Applies to deduction of STANDARD_IA storage usage, not to deduction of MAZ_STANDARD_IA storage usage. | Every day, the average storage usage of the day is deducted, and the deduction is reset.<br><br> For example, if you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 20 GB on the 1st day of the month, and your bucket used 10 GB, 20 GB, and 30 GB of STANDARD storage on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day respectively, then 10 GB, 20 GB, and 20 GB could be deducted from the storage pack of 20 GB on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day respectively, and the excess usage of 10 GB on the 3rd day would be billed in a pay-as-you-go manner. |
| Request pack         | Request packs for the following storage classes are available:<br><li>STANDARD request packet: Applies to deduction of STANDARD read/write requests.<br><li>STANDARD_IA request pack: Applies to deduction of STANDARD_IA read/write requests. |   The total number of requests of the day are deducted every day, and the deduction is reset every month.<br><br>For example, if you purchased a STANDARD request pack of 1,000,000 times on the 1st day of the month, and your bucket generated 100,000 requests every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, then 100,000 requests would be deducted from the request pack of 1,000,000 times every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, and there would still be 700,000 requests available on the 4th day.  |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Applies to deduction of public network downstream traffic                    |  The total amount of traffic of the day is deducted every day, and the deduction is reset every month.<br><br>For example, if you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 100 GB on the 1st day of the month, and your bucket generated 10 GB of public network downstream traffic every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, then 10 GB of traffic would be deducted from the traffic pack of 100 GB every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, and there would still be 70 GB of traffic available on the 4th day. |
| Global acceleration traffic pack | Applies to deduction of global acceleration traffic. Global acceleration traffic packs are divided into the following categories according to the data transfer acceleration direction:<br><li>For regions in the Chinese mainland: Applies to deduction of global acceleration traffic (upstream and downstream) generated by transfer between regions in the Chinese mainland, not finance cloud regions.<br><li>For regions outside the Chinese mainland: Applies to global acceleration traffic (upstream and downstream) generated by transfer between regions in the Chinese mainland and outside the Chinese mainland or between regions outside the Chinese mainland. |  The total amount of traffic of the day is deducted every day, and the deduction is reset every month.<br><br>For example, if you purchased a global acceleration traffic pack of 100 GB, and your bucket generated 10 GB of global acceleration traffic every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, then 10 GB of traffic would be deducted from the traffic pack of 100 GB every day from the 1st day to the 3rd day, and there would still be 70 GB of traffic available for deduction on the 4th day.</li>  |

## Resource Pack Pricing

For the pricing details of resource packs, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).


## Purchase Notes<a id="purchasenotes"></a>


1. Resource packs are available only in public cloud regions, not in finance cloud regions. For more information on regions, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224).
2. Resource packs can be applied only to deduction of the resource usage of the bucket in the same region as the resource pack (such as a public cloud region in the Chinese mainland, not a finance cloud region). Therefore, be sure to select a resource pack in the same [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224) as your bucket.
3. Resource packs are prepaid and can be configured to take effect immediately or at a specified time based on your actual use case. If a resource pack is configured to take effect immediately, it will take effect immediately **on the day** of purchase without any operation required. If a resource pack is configured to take effect at a specified time, it will take effect at the specified time, and your usage will be billed in a pay-as-you-go manner before the resource pack takes effect.
4. The validity period of a resource pack starts from the configured effective date. Resource packs purchased or renewed before December 1, 2021 are valid for 30 days; resource packs purchased or renewed on or after December 1, 2021 expire on the same day the next month.
5. Resource packs can be purchased for multiple cycles. If you purchase a resource pack for multiple cycles, the resource pack resetting date will apply. For more information, see [Resource Pack Validity Period](#.E8.B5.84.E6.BA.90.E5.8C.85.E6.9C.89.E6.95.88.E6.9C.9F).
6. The remaining portion of a resource pack not used up in a cycle cannot roll over to the next cycle.
7. A self-service refund is supported for resource packs. If you purchase an inappropriate resource pack by mistake, you can request a [self-service refund](#2) if the refund conditions are met.
8. Multiple resource packs can be used together. If you purchase multiple resource packs at a time, their specifications can be combined, not their validity periods. For more information on the effective date, see [Resource Pack Validity Period](#.E8.B5.84.E6.BA.90.E5.8C.85.E6.9C.89.E6.95.88.E6.9C.9F).
9. After a resource pack expires or is used up, you don't need to migrate the data in your bucket, and pay-as-you-go billing will be adopted.
10. While the resource pack is effective, bills will be settled in the following sequence: **free tier > resource pack > pay-as-you-go**. Usage beyond the free tier and the resource pack's capacity will be billed using the **pay-as-you-go** mode.
11. If an account has overdue payments (the account's balance is below 0), COS will be suspended after 24 hours, regardless of whether the resource pack is effective or not.
12. Currently, resource packs are available only for certain billable items (such as storage and requests). During the use of COS, other fees (such as data retrieval fees and management feature fees) may be incurred and will be charged based on your actual usage.

## Resource Pack Validity Period


### Definition

1. Validity period: A period of time from the effective date to the expiration time of a resource pack.
2. Resetting date: The date on which the specification of a resource pack is reset, after which you will get the same amount of usage as the specification.
 - Storage pack: The usage of a resource pack is reset every day during its validity period. The resetting date is subject to the validity period, not the purchase date.
 - Read/Write request pack and traffic pack: The usage of a resource pack is reset every cycle during its validity period. The resetting date is subject to the validity period, not the purchase date. If you purchase a resource pack with a validity period of three months, and one month is a cycle by default, then the resource pack has two resetting dates.
3. Cycle: The validity period of a resource pack is divided into several cycles, and **one month is a cycle by default**. If you purchase a resource pack with a validity period of three months, the resource pack has three cycles.
 - Viewing how many cycles a resource pack has: In the **[COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos), select **Resource Packs** > **Purchased** > **Operation** and click **Usage details** to view the cycles of the resource pack as well as the usage details of the resource pack in the current and historical cycles.
 - Viewing the resetting date of a resource pack: In the **[COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos), select **Resource Packs** > **Purchased** > **Usage Description** to view the resetting date of the resource pack.


For example:
1. If you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 10 GB with a validity period of one month on December 1, 2021, then:
 - Validity period: From 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 to 23:59:59 on January 1, 2022.
 - Resetting date: The resource pack will be reset to 10 GB every day during its validity period, that is, 10 GB of STANDARD storage usage can be deducted every day.
 - Cycle: The resource pack has only one cycle, i.e., from December 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022.
2. If you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 10 GB with a validity period of three months on December 1, 2021, then:
 - Validity period: From 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 to 23:59:59 on March 1, 2022
 - Resetting date: The resource pack has two resetting dates: 24:00:00 on January 1, 2022 (i.e., 00:00:00 on January 2, 2022) and 24:00:00 on February 1, 2022 (i.e., 00:00:00 on February 2, 2022). You can get new 10 GB of public network downstream traffic on each resetting date for deduction of the public network downstream traffic generated in the current cycle.
 - Cycle: The resource pack has three cycles: From December 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022, from January 2, 2022 to February 1, 2022, and from February 2, 2022 to March 1, 2022.


### Calculation logic

#### Validity period and resetting date of a purchased resource pack

Note: If you purchased a traffic pack or read/write request pack with a validity period of N month(s) on a day (B) in a month (A), then the resource pack would expire on the same day (B) in the month (A+N) and be reset at 24:00:00 on the same day (B) every month, and have (N-1) resetting dates and N cycles.

Logic:
1. If the resource pack takes effect on the last day of the current month, it will expire on the last day of the target month.
2. If the current date of the current month is greater than the total number of days of the target month, the resource pack will expire on the last day of the target month.
3. In other cases, the resource pack will expire on the same date as the number of days of the target month.

For example:

| Resource Pack Type | Operation | Purchase Duration | Purchase Date | Effective Date | Expiration Time | Resetting Time |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | One month | December 1, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 1, 2022 | - |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Two months | December 1, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 | 23:59:59 on February 1, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 1, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Three months | December 1, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 | 23:59:59 on March 1, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 1, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 1, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | One month | December 15, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 15, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 15, 2022 | - |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Two months | December 15, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 15, 2021  | 23:59:59 on February 15, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 15, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Three months | December 15, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 15, 2021 | 23:59:59 on March 15, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 15, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 15, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | One month | December 29, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 29, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 29, 2022 | - |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Two months | December 29, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 29, 2021  | 23:59:59 on February 28, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 29, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase | Three months | December 29, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 29, 2021 | 23:59:59 on March 29, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 29, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 28, 2022 |



#### Validity period of a renewed resource pack: the same as a purchased resource pack

Note: If you purchased a traffic pack or read/write request pack with a validity period of N month(s) on a day (B) in a month (A) and renewed it for M month(s), the resource pack would expire on the same day (B) in the month (A+N+M) and be reset at 24:00:00 on the same day (B) every month, and have (N+M-1) resetting dates and (N+M) cycles.

Logic:
1. If the resource pack takes effect on the last day of the current month, it will expire on the last day of the target month.
2. If the current date of the current month is greater than the total number of days in the target month, the resource pack will expire on the last day of the target month.
3. In other cases, the resource pack will expire on the same date as the number of days in the target month.

For example:

| Resource Pack Type | Operation | Purchase Duration | Purchase Date | Effective Date | Expiration Time Before Renewal | Renewal Duration | Expiration Time After Renewal | Resetting Time |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 1, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 1, 2022 | One month | 23:59:59 on February 1, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 1, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 1, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 1, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 1, 2022 | Two months | 23:59:59 on March 1, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 1, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 1, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 15, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 15, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 15, 2022 | One month | 23:59:59 on February 15, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 15, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 15, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 15, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 15, 2022 | Two months | 23:59:59 on March 15, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 15, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 15, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 29, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 29, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 29, 2022 | One month | 23:59:59 on February 28, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 29, 2022 |
| Public network downstream traffic pack | Purchase and renewal before expiration | One month | December 29, 2021 | 00:00:00 on December 29, 2021 | 23:59:59 on January 29, 2022 | Two months | 23:59:59 on March 29, 2022 | 24:00:00 on January 29, 2022 and 24:00:00 on February 28, 2022 |


## Resource Pack Deduction

**Deduction example**

Assume that you purchased two **STANDARD storage packs** of 200 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of three months and two **public network downstream traffic packs** of 200 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of three months on January 15, 2019, then:

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Resource Pack Type</th>
      <th>Deduction Description</th>
      <th>Validity Period</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Two STANDARD storage packs</td>
      <td>Within the validity period, they could be applied to deduction of 400 GB of STANDARD storage used by buckets in public cloud regions in the Chinese mainland (not finance cloud regions).</td>
      <td>January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2019</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Two public network downstream traffic packs</td>
      <td>Every month (30 days), they could be applied to deduction of 400 GB of public network downstream traffic generated by buckets in public cloud regions in the Chinese mainland (not finance cloud regions).</td>
      <td>January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2019</td>
   </tr>
</table>


**Deduction order example**

Assume that you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 500 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland, and the resource pack was within the validity period. The following describes the deduction order of resource packs in different use cases:

- Use case involving different unit prices
If you uploaded 700 GB of data to a bucket in **Guangzhou** in the STANDARD storage class and 300 GB of data to a bucket in **Chengdu** in the STANDARD storage class on the day, then in line with the principle of **higher unit price, first deduct**, the STANDARD storage pack of 500 GB would be first applied to deduction of the STANDARD storage used by the bucket in **Guangzhou**.

- Use case involving the same unit price
If you uploaded 700 GB of data to a bucket in Guangzhou in the STANDARD storage class and 300 GB of data to a bucket in Beijing in the STANDARD storage class, then the STANDARD storage pack of 500 GB would be applied to deduction in the following order: **Shanghai > Guangzhou > Beijing-1 > Singapore > Chengdu > Hong Kong (China) > Toronto > Frankfurt > Beijing > Seoul > Mumbai > Virginia > Silicon Valley > Bangkok > Tokyo > Nanjing > Jakarta > São Paulo > Chongqing**.




## Resource Pack Effective Scope

**Example**

Assume that you purchased a **STANDARD storage pack** of **200 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland** with a validity period of three months on January 15, 2019.

If, from January 15 to January 31, your bucket in **Guangzhou region** used **100 GB of STANDARD storage**, 50 GB of STANDARD_IA storage, and 1 million read/write requests and downloaded 10 GB of data over the public network, and your bucket in Singapore region used 50 GB of STANDARD storage, then:

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Generated Billable Item</th>
      <th>Whether the Resource Pack Is Effective</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>100 GB of STANDARD storage usage in Guangzhou region</td>
      <td>Yes. The resource pack would be applied to deduction of 100 GB of STANDARD storage usage every day during the validity period.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>50 GB of STANDARD_IA storage usage in Guangzhou region</td>
      <td>No. The resource pack could not be applied to deduction of STANDARD_IA storage usage, which would be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>1 million read/write requests in Guangzhou region</td>
      <td>No. The resource pack could not be applied to deduction of read/write requests, which would be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>10 GB of public network downstream traffic in Guangzhou region</td>
      <td>No. The resource pack could not be applied to deduction of public network downstream traffic, which would be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>50 GB of STANDARD storage usage in Singapore region</td>
      <td>No. The resource pack could not be applied to deduction of your usage in Singapore region, which would be billed on a pay-as-you-go basis.</td>
   </tr>
