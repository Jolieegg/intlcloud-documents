Storage usage refers to the storage used. The rate you are charged depends on the objectsâ€² size and how long you stored them. For different storage classes, the unit price, minimum object size, and minimum storage duration period are different, which will be described below. The actual costs depend on the use case and storage class of the object.

<td><strong>Early deletion</strong> refers to the deletion of an object in the STANDARD_IA, MAZ_STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, or DEEP ARCHIVE storage class performed before it meets the minimum storage duration requirement after being uploaded. <br><br>Note: Early deletion fees will be incurred in storage classes with the minimum storage duration requirement, i.e., STANDARD_IA, MAZ_STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE.
<br><br>Billing rule:
<li>If an object is deleted before it meets the minimum storage duration requirement, the storage usage fees incurred by it will be calculated based on the minimum storage duration as detailed below:
<li>STANDARD_IA or MAZ_STANDARD_IA storage of data for less than 30 days will be calculated as 30 days.
<li>ARCHIVE storage of data for less than 90 days will be calculated as 90 days.
<li>DEEP ARCHIVE storage of data for less than 180 days will be calculated as 180 days.
<br><br>The following operations may cause early deletion:
<br>1. You delete an object in advance before it meets the minimum storage duration requirement.
<br>2. You modify the attributes of an object before it meets the minimum storage duration requirement, such as custom header or storage class. In this case, COS will delete the original object after successful modification, and storage fees incurred by early object deletion will be charged.
<br>3. You upload an object with the same name as an existing object to a bucket with versioning not enabled before the existing object meets the minimum storage duration requirement. In this case, COS will delete the existing object, and storage fees incurred by early object deletion will be charged.

## Billing Mode and Calculation Formula

| Billing Mode | Calculation Formula |
|-----|-------|
|  Pay-as-you-go   | <ul  style="margin: 0;"> <li>Daily billing cycle</li><li>Daily storage usage fees = monthly unit price / 30 * daily storage usage</li><li>Daily storage usage = sum of "5-minute usage" / 288 (number of statistical points)</li></ul>  |
|  Storage pack      |     The following types of storage packs are available:<ul  style="margin: 0;"> <li>STANDARD storage pack: Applies to deduction of STANDARD storage usage, not to deduction of MAZ_STANDARD storage usage</li><li>STANDARD_IA storage pack: Applies to deduction of STANDARD_IA storage usage, not to deduction of MAZ_STANDARD_IA storage usage</li></ul>During the validity period of a storage pack, the storage used every day (including the day of purchase) can be deducted from the storage pack, and any excess usage will be billed in a pay-as-you-go manner. |

## Storage Usage Pricing


>?
>For the unit prices of storage usage, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

## Billing Examples

>?
>- Prices in the following examples are for reference only. For the actual prices, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).
>- The storage capacity is calculated in binary, for example, 1 TB = 1,024 GB.

### Example 1: STANDARD storage usage fees + STANDARD request fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded 10 GB of data to a bucket residing in Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class, generating 100 requests, and purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 10 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of one month for 0.24 USD. Apart from this, user A did not perform any other operations. As fees for a day were settled the next day, then:

- STANDARD storage usage fees: Settled daily starting from November 2, 2020.
- STANDARD request fees: Settled on November 2, 2020.

An analysis is performed as follows based on the two billing modes:

-  Pay-as-you-go:
 - STANDARD storage usage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month / 30 * 10 GB * 30 days = 0.24 USD
 - STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests * 100 requests / 10,000 = 0.00002 USD
- STANDARD storage pack: 10 GB of STANDARD storage usage was deducted every day for a total of 30 days from November 1 to November 30, 2020.

In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.00002 = 0.24002 USD.


### Example 2: STANDARD_IA storage usage fees + STANDARD_IA request fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user B uploaded 10 GB of data (including 10,000 pieces of 34 KB objects and all other pieces of 64 KB or larger objects) to a bucket residing in Guangzhou region in the STANDARD_IA storage class, generating 100 requests, and purchased a STANDARD_IA storage pack of 10 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of one month for 0.18 USD. Apart from this, user B did not perform any other operations in November. As fees for a day were settled the next day, then:

- STANDARD_IA storage usage fees: Settled daily starting from November 2, 2020.
- STANDARD_IA request fees: Settled on November 2, 2020.

An analysis is performed as follows based on the two billing modes:

-  Pay-as-you-go:
   - STANDARD_IA storage usage = 10 GB + 10,000 * (64 - 34) KB = 10.286 GB.
    >?As an object of less than 64 KB is counted as 64 KB, additional storage usage of 10,000 * (64 - 34 KB) will be billed.
- STANDARD_IA storage usage fees = 0.018 USD/GB/month / 30 * 10.286 GB * 30 days = 0.19 USD
- STANDARD_IA request fees = 0.01 USD/10,000 requests * 100 requests / 10,000 = 0.0001 USD
- STANDARD_IA storage pack: 10 GB of STANDARD_IA storage usage was deducted every day for a total of 30 days from November 1 to November 30, 2020.

In summary, the total bill for user B in November is calculated as follows: 0.18 + 0.0001 = 0.1801 USD.
