Billable requests include **user requests** and **backend requests** generated after you configure a feature. The request fees are billed by the number of requests sent to COS.

- User requests: Include requests sent to COS to upload, download, query, delete, and perform other operations through APIs, SDKs, or the console.
- Backend requests: Include requests to delete STANDARD copies (when the restored archived objects expired or after a lifecycle transition), read/write data for cross-bucket replication, and deliver inventory reports.

Requests that incur fees include read/write requests, INTELLIGENT TIERING object monitoring, and requests that are sent to retrieve DEEP ARCHIVE data. The following fees will be incurred if you use relevant services:
- Object monitoring fees: Incurred if you upload an object in the INTELLIGENT TIERING storage class to an INTELLIGENT TIERING-enabled bucket, which will be billed by the number of uploaded objects at least 64 KB in size.
- Data retrieval request fees: Incurred if you send requests to restore DEEP ARCHIVE data.

### Example: STANDARD storage usage fees + STANDARD request fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded 10 GB of data to a bucket residing in Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class and called the `Bucket API` API to query the object list 100,000 times on the same day. Apart from these operations, user A did not perform any other operations. As fees for a day were settled the next day:

- STANDARD storage usage fees: Settled daily starting from November 2, 2020.
- STANDARD request fees: Settled on November 2, 2020.

Fees analysis:

- STANDARD storage usage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month / 30 * 10 GB * 30 days = 0.24 USD
- STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests * 100,000 requests = 0.02 USD


In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.02 = 0.26 USD.
