Billable items in COS include [storage usage](#jf1), [requests](#jf2), [data retrievals](#jf3), [traffic](#jf4), and [management features](#jf5). The following describes each billable item in detail.


> ?COS offers the following object storage classes for different access frequencies and disaster recovery needs: INTELLIGENT TIERING, STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. For more information, please see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

## Pricing

## Storage Usage Fees

| Billable Item | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Definition | Billing Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage usage | INTELLIGENT TIERING<br>STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE | Storage usage is the actual storage capacity consumed by your data. It is billed based on the actual size of the storage capacity used. | <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>Storage usage fees = Storage usage unit price x Monthly storage usage<br><li>Monthly storage usage = Sum of "daily storage usage" in the month/Number of days in the month<br><li>Daily storage usage = Sum of "5-minute storage usage"/288 (number of statistical points) |



#### Billing restrictions

1. STANDARD_IA: Storage duration of fewer than 30 days will be calculated as 30 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual sizes.
2. ARCHIVE: available in public cloud regions only. Storage duration of fewer than 90 days will be calculated as 90 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual sizes.
3. DEEP ARCHIVE: available only in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu regions. Storage duration of fewer than 180 days will be calculated as 180 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual sizes.
4. If you successfully uploaded an object to STANDARD_IA or ARCHIVE without enabling versioning, COS will delete the existing object (if any) that has the **same name**. In this case, storage fees will still be incurred for **early deletion of the object**.
5. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, storage usage fees of objects are consistent with the storage class after object movement. Also, you will be charged the object monitoring fees.

## Request Fees

Request fees include the fees incurred by **user requests** and **backend requests** generated by feature configuration.

- User requests: include requests to Tencent COS to upload, download, query, delete, and perform other operations via APIs, SDKs, or console.
- Backend requests: include requests to delete STANDARD copies after lifecycle transition or expiration of STANDARD copies restored from ARCHIVED expired, read/write data for cross-region replication, and deliver inventory reports.

| Billable Item | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Definition | Billing Description |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Number of requests | INTELLIGENT TIERING<br>STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE | Calculated based on the number of requests sent  | <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>If the accumulated number of requests is less than 10,000, the bill is calculated as 10,000.<br><li>Request fees = Unit price per 10,000 requests x Monthly accumulated number of requests/10,000 |
| Monitoring times | INTELLIGENT TIERING  | Calculated based on the object monitoring times (monitoring data access) | <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>If the accumulated monitoring times are less than 10,000, the bill is calculated as 10,000.<br><li>Object monitoring fees = Unit price per 10,000 monitoring times x Monthly accumulated monitoring times/10,000 |
| Number of requests for data retrieval | DEEP ARCHIVE | Calculated based on the number of requests sent for retrieving DEEP ARCHIVED data | <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>If the accumulated number of retrieval requests is less than 10,000, the bill is calculated as 10,000.<br><li>Request fees for retrieving data = Unit price per 10,000 requests x Monthly accumulated number of requests/10,000 |

#### Billing restrictions

1. Both successful and failed requests are billed.
2. The minimum number of requests for billing is 10,000. Therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is less than 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests, regardless of request success or failure.
3. Data in the ARCHIVE and DEEP ARCHIVE storage classes cannot be read or downloaded. If you restore objects from ARCHIVE to STANDARD, you will be billed at STANDARD rates; if you restore objects in the DEEP ARCHIVE storage class, you will be billed at DEEP ARCHIVE rates.
4. If you restore DEEP ARCHIVED data, request fees for data retrieval will be incurred. The request fees vary depending on the restoration mode.
5. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, request fees are subject to those of the storage class after object movement.

   </tr>
</table>


#### Billing restrictions

Storage classes suitable for cold data include **STANDARD_IA**, **ARCHIVE**, and **DEEP ARCHIVE**. To read or download data in STANDARD_IA, COS needs to retrieve it first. ARCHIVED data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored to the STANDARD storage class.

## Traffic Fees

Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by reading the data stored.

      <td><li>Daily billing cycle<br><li>Global acceleration traffic fees = Unit price per GB x Daily accumulated global acceleration traffic</td>
   </tr> 
</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. ARCHIVED data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored to the STANDARD storage class. Therefore, traffic generated from these requests is counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. **Public network downstream traffic** is generated when the data is returned to COS through origin-pull using a third-party CDN service.
3. After CDN acceleration is enabled, CDN origin-pull traffic is generated when a user browses or downloads COS data on the client through **a Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration endpoint**.
4. Public network downstream traffic is generated when a user downloads objects through **object links** or browses objects through a **static website endpoint**. 
5. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees vary, depending on the region where the source bucket resides.
6. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, traffic fees are subject to those of the storage class after object movement.

> ?Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [COS Access via Private Network and Public Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613).


#### Traffic trends

The figure below shows the traffic fees incurred by data transmitted from COS to an end user with Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration endpoint enabled and disabled, respectively.
