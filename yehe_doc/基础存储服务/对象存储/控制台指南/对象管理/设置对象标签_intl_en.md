## Overview

Object tagging is designed to help you group and manage objects in your bucket by adding a key-value pair as an object tag. An object tag consists of a `tagKey`, a `=`, and a `tagValue`, such as `group = IT`. You can set, query, and delete tags on the specified object.

## Notes

- Object tagging is a paid feature. For detailed pricing, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/cos?lang=en&pg=).
- You can add up to ten unique tags for an object.
- Tag keys and tag values are case-sensitive. Both of them can contain 1â€“127 UTF-8 letters, spaces, digits, or special symbols `+ - = ._ : / @ `.
For more restrictions, see [Object Tag Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/35665).
