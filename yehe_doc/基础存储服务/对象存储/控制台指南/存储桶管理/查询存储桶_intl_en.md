## Overview
You can quickly query the created buckets by bucket name and tag in the COS console.

>!
>- Before you can access the bucket list with a sub-account, the sub-account must be authorized by the root account. For more information, see [Accessing Bucket List Using Sub-Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/17061).
>- As the `List Bucket` operation is not restricted by bucket permission, a sub-account cannot be restricted to querying just specified buckets.

## Querying by Bucket Name or Tag

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click **Bucket List** on the left sidebar to enter the bucket list page, where you can view all the created buckets.
2. If there are many buckets, you can search for buckets by **bucket name** or **tag** in the top-right corner of the **Bucket List** page.
 - Query by **bucket name**: You can enter a specific bucket name or a bucket name **prefix** to query buckets.

 - Query by **tag**: If you have set tags for a bucket as instructed in [Setting Bucket Tags](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30928), you can also select **Tag** in the top-right corner of the **Bucket List** page and enter a **tag key** to query buckets.
