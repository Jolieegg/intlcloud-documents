## Overview

This document describes how to use the audio moderation feature in the console to check audio content for **pornographic**, **illegal**, and **advertising** information.

After you configure automatic audio moderation, **new** audios uploaded to a bucket will be automatically moderated, and the identified non-compliant content can be automatically blocked (by denying public read access to the content).

You can also moderate existing audios stored in COS. For more information, see [Audio Moderation](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/48261).

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket). On the **Bucket List** page, click the target bucket to enter the bucket details page.
2. On the left sidebar, select **Sensitive Content Moderation** > **Automatic Moderation Configuration** and click **Audio Moderation**.
3. Click **Add Automatic Audio Moderation Configuration** and set the following configuration items:
   - **Moderation Scope**: Select the scope of audio files to be moderated, which can be the entire bucket, a specific directory, or a specific file prefix.
   - **Moderation Suffix**: The following audio formats can be moderated: MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, AMR, 3GP, M4A, WMA, OGG, and APE. You can select multiple formats.
   - **Moderation Policy**: Select a moderation policy. You can create different policies for refined moderation. If no policies have been configured, the default policy will be used. Moderation scene options include **Pornographic**, **Illegal**, and **Advertisement**, and you can select one or multiple options. For detailed directions on how to configure a moderation policy, see [Setting Moderation Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/52095).
   - **Moderation Scene**: It displays the scene that you configure in the moderation policy. You can select the target scene as needed.
   - **File block configuration**: You can enable this service to authorize CI to perform automatic or human moderation and block the identified non-compliant files by denying public read access to them. After enabling this service, you need to select the block type and score range of audios to be blocked.
   - **Block mode**: The following two block modes are supported:
     - Change the file ACL to private read: Doing so actually blocks the file. Then, a 403 status code will be returned when the file is accessed again, indicating that access is denied. For more information on file permissions, see [ACL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30583).
     - Transfer the file to the backup directory: Doing so actually blocks the file. Then, a 404 status code will be returned when the file is accessed again, indicating that the file does not exist. The backup directory is automatically generated by the backend at `audit_freeze_backup/increment_audit` in the current bucket.
   - **Block Type**: You can select a block type and mechanism. **Machine moderation and block** is selected by default. If you select **Human moderation and block**, Tencent Cloud security team will review suspiciously sensitive audios identified during machine moderation. You can select the audio score range for blocking (by specifying an integer between 60 and 100; the greater the score, the more sensitive the audio).
   - **Callback**: After callback is enabled, you will receive moderation results. You need to select the moderation type and callback content and set the callback URL. For more information, see [Callback Content](#1).
4. After completing the configuration, click **Save**. Audios uploaded subsequently will be moderated.

## Callback Content

If you enable callback, after audio moderation is completed, the system will send the following callback message to the callback URL:

```plaintext
{
    "code":0,
    "message":"success",
    "data":{
        "url":"",
        "result":1,

## Notes

1. Audio moderation adopts a scoring mechanism, with a score between 0 and 100 returned for each audio.
2. The **confirmed part** refers to the audios that are confirmed to be normal or sensitive (with a score in the range of [0,60] or (90,100]). For such audios, no manual intervention is required.
3. The **uncertain part** refers to the audios that are suspected to be sensitive (with a score in the range of (60,90]). For such audios, human moderation is recommended.
