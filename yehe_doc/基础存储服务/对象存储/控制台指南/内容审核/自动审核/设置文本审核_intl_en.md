## Overview

This document describes how to use the text moderation feature in the COS console. The feature can check text content for **pornographic**, **illegal**, **advertising**, and **abusive** information.

After you enable text moderation, **new** text files uploaded to a bucket will be automatically moderated, and the identified non-compliant content can be automatically blocked (by denying public read access to the content).



>?
> - Text moderation is billed by CI.
> - Text moderation is billed by moderation times. Every 10,000 UTF-8 characters is counted as one moderation operation, and less than 10,000 characters are counted as 10,000 characters. 
> - Currently, the text moderation feature supports TXT files and files without extensions, and the file size cannot exceed 1 MB.
> - Text moderation can recognize Mandarin and English.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. Click **Bucket List** on the left sidebar.
3. Click the name of the target bucket to go to the configuration page.
4. On the left sidebar, select **Sensitive Content Moderation** > **Automatic Moderation Configuration** and click **Text Moderation**.
5. Click **Add Automatic Text Moderation Configuration** and set the following configuration items:
   - **Moderation Scope**: You can select **The whole bucket** or **Specified Range**.
     - **Path**: If you select **Specified Range**, enter the path of the text files to be moderated. <br>Example 1: To moderate files in the test directory, set this field to `test/`.<br>Example 2: To moderate files prefixed with `123`, set this field to `123`.
>!You can add multiple moderation configurations, but the paths cannot be duplicate or have inclusion relationships. If you have configured to moderate the entire bucket, you cannot add a moderation configuration for a specific path in the bucket.
>
 - **Moderation Suffix**: Options include **TXT**, **HTML**, and **Without suffix**.
 - **Moderation Policy**: Select a moderation policy. You can create different policies for refined moderation. Moderation scene options include **Pornographic**, **Illegal**, and **Advertisement**, and you can select one or multiple options. For detailed directions on how to configure a moderation policy, see [Setting Moderation Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/52095).
 - **Moderation Scene**: Moderation scene options include moderation for pornographic, advertising, and abusive content, and you can select one or multiple options.
 - **File block configuration**: You can enable this service to authorize CI to perform automatic or human moderation and block the identified non-compliant files by denying public read access to them.
 - **Block mode**: The following two block modes are supported:
     - Change the file ACL to private read: Doing so actually blocks the file. Then, a 403 status code will be returned when the file is accessed again, indicating that access is denied. For more information on file permissions, see [ACL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30583).
     - Transfer the file to the backup directory: Doing so actually blocks the file. Then, a 404 status code will be returned when the file is accessed again, indicating that the file does not exist. The backup directory is automatically generated by the backend at `audit_freeze_backup/increment_audit` in the current bucket.
 - **Block Type**: You can select a block type and mechanism. **Machine moderation and block** is selected by default. If you select **Human moderation and block**, Tencent Cloud security team will review suspiciously sensitive text files identified during machine moderation.

 - **Callback**: After callback is enabled, you will receive moderation results. You need to select the moderation type and callback content and set the callback URL. For more information, see [Callback Content](#1).
6. After completing the configuration, click **Save**. Text files uploaded subsequently will be moderated.

## Callback Content

After callback is enabled, the system will send the following default callback message to the set URL to check whether it can receive callback messages normally:
```plaintext
{
   "code": 0,
   "data": {
       "forbidden_status": 0,
       "porn_info": {
           "hit_flag": 0,
           "label": "",
           "count": 9
       },
       "result": 0,
       "trace_id": "test_trace_id",
       "url": "test_text"
   },
   "message": "Test request when setting callback url"
}
```

>?
> - If the callback option is selected, text files frozen by Tencent Cloud will be returned to you, with public read access to them denied.
> - The callback URL must begin with "http" or "https" and return a 200 status code by default before it can be used. Check it before saving the settings.
> - The callback URL will take effect in 30 minutes.
> 

After the callback URL takes effect, when an uploaded text file hits moderation rules, the system will call back the URL by default and send a standard HTTP POST notification message to it. The HTTP packet is as follows:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :------- |
| forbidden_status | Block status. Valid values: `0` (normal); `1` (blocked).                  | Int    | Yes       |
| porn_info        | Porn detection information, including moderation result, score, and detailed tags.            | json   | Yes       |
| ads_info         | Ad detection information, including moderation result, score, and detailed tags.        | json   | Yes       |
| result           | Recognition result for reference. Valid values: `0` (normal), `1` (sensitive), `2` (suspiciously sensitive). | Int    | Yes       |
| trace_id         | `jobid` of the submitted moderation job.                                       | String | Yes       |
| url              | The URL of the uploaded resource, including the domain name.                             | String | Yes       |
| illegal_info        | Illegal information detection information, including moderation result, score, and detailed tags.            | json   | No       |
| abuse_info       | Abuse detection information, including moderation result, score, and detailed tags.            | json   | No       |

The moderation information (`porn_info`, `ads_info`, `illegal_info`, and `abuse_info`) has the following sub-nodes:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----- | :------- |
| hit_flag | Whether the moderation type is hit. | Int    | Yes       |
| label    | Recognized text tag.                                             | String | Yes       |
| count | Text file callback parameter, which is the number of sensitive text segments that hit the moderation scene. | Int    | Yes       |

Below is a sample callback:

```plaintext
{	
    "code":0,
 	  "message":"success",
 	  "data":{
 		 "url":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 		 "result":1,
 		 "forbidden_status":1,
 		 "trace_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 		 "porn_info":{
 			 "hit_flag":1,
 			 "label":"Obscene",
 			 "count":3
 		  },
    },
}
```
