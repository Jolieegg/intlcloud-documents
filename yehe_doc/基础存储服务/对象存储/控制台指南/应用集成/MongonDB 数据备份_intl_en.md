## Overview

MongoDB Backup is a [SCF](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583)-based feature provided by COS. It allows you to back up data in TencentDB for MongoDB to COS so that data can be stored persistently and stay safe from data loss or corruption. After you set a backup function rule for a bucket, SCF will scan your MongoDB backup files periodically and store them in the bucket.

## Notes

- MongoDB Backup functions only back up the backup files of TencentDB for MongoDB. Therefore, if MongoDB backup has not been enabled, the functions cannot be executed. For more information about TencentDB for MongoDB backups, please see [Backing up TencentDB for MongoDB ](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/7108).
- If you have added a MongoDB backup rule to your bucket via the COS console, the backup function will appear in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default). **DO NOT** delete this function. Otherwise, your rule may not take effect.
- Regions where SCF is available support MongoDB Backup, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Mumbai, Toronto, and Silicon Valley, and more. For more supported regions, please see [SCF Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583).

 - **Function Name**: uniquely identifies a function and cannot be modified after being set. You can view the function in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default).
 - **Associated Bucket**: a bucket to store the MongoDB backup files
 - **Trigger Period**: triggers the backup operation for the MongoDB Backup function. Every day, every week, and custom periods are supported.
 - **Cron Expression**: If you use a custom period, you can use Cron to specify the trigger period rule. Cron follows China Standard Time (UTC+8:00). For detailed configuration policies, please see [Cron Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/9708).
 - **Database Instance**: MongoDB instance in the region where the current bucket resides
 - **Delivery Path**: delivery path prefix of the backup files. If not specified, backup files will be stored in the root directory of the bucket.
 - **SCF Authorization**: SCF needs to be authorized so that it can read the MongoDB instances as well as their backup files, and store the backup files to the specified bucket.
6. Click **Confirm** to add the function.
