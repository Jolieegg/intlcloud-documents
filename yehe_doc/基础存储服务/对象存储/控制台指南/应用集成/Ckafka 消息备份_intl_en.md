## Overview

CKafka message backup is provided by COS based on [SCF](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/583) to dump CKafka messages to COS, which facilitates data analysis and download.

Based on the open-source Apache Kafka message queuing engine, Tencent Cloud Kafka (CKafka) provides high-throughput and highly scalable message queuing services. For more information, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/10066).

If a backup rule has been configured for a bucket, messages generated in a CKafka instance will be dumped to the COS bucket according to the specified time granularity.

## Notes

- If you have added a CKafka message backup rule to your bucket via the COS console, the function will appear in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default). **DO NOT** delete the function. Otherwise, your rule may not take effect.
- CKafka message backup is supported in SCF-enabled regions, including Guangzhou, Hong Kong (China), Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Singapore, Mumbai, Toronto, and Silicon Valley. For more supported regions, see the [SCF documentation](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/583).

## Directions

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Application Integration** > **Data Backup** and find **CKafka Message Backup**.
3. Click **Configure Backup Rule** to go to the rule configuration page.
4. Click **Add Function**.
>! If you haven't activated SCF, go to the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf) to activate it and authorize the service as instructed.
>
5. In the pop-up window, configure the following items:

 - **Function Name**: Uniquely identifies a function and cannot be modified after being set. You can view the function in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default).
 - **Associated Bucket**: A COS bucket that stores CKafka messages
 - **Time Granularity**: You can set an interval (5âˆ’15 minutes) to aggregate messages according to the message volume. The dumping performance is affected by the number of files aggregated, the number of partitions, and the value of `partition_max`. For more information, see **Partition** in [Glossary](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/32275).
 - **SCF Authorization**: (required) SCF needs to be authorized to read messages of CKafka instances and dump the messages to the specified bucket.
6. Click **Next** to configure CKafka as follows:

 - **Instance**: A CKafka instance that is used as the message source. Only instances in the same region are supported.
 - **Topic**: A topic used as the message source
 - **Start Point**: The topic offset for dumping the backup messages
 - **Address**: A VPC address is required. CKafka instances that use a classic network require a routing policy. For more information, see [Adding Routing Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/32555).
>! An IP address in the corresponding VPC subnet must be available and support DHCP.
>
7. Click **Next** to configure delivery. The configuration item is as follows:

**Destination Path**: A path to deliver the backup messages. If this field is not specified, the files will be stored in the root directory of the bucket. To use a prefix, end it with a slash (/).
8. Click **Confirm**.
You can perform the following operations on the created function:
 - Click **Log** to view the historical running status of CKafka message backup. If an error is reported, you can click **Log** to quickly redirect to the SCF console for viewing the error log details.
 - Click **More** > **Edit** to modify the CKafka message backup rule.
 - Click **More** > **Delete** to delete the unwanted CKafka message backup rule.
