## Overview

Cloud database backup is a [SCF](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583)-based database backup feature provided by COS. It allows you to store data in TencentDB to COS so that data can be stored persistently and stay safe from data loss or corruption. After you set a backup function rule for a specified bucket, SCF will scan your database backup files periodically and store them in the bucket.

## Notes:
- Cloud database backup functions back up only TencentDB backup files. Therefore, if database backup has not been enabled, the functions cannot be executed. For more information about TencentDB backups, please see [Backing up Databases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/37796).
- Currently, only backing up TencentDB for MySQL is supported.
- If you have added a cloud database backup function rule to your bucket via the COS console, the function will appear in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default). **DO NOT** delete the function. Otherwise, your rule may not take effect.
- Regions where SCF is available support cloud database backup, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Mumbai, Toronto, and Silicon Valley, and more. For more supported regions, please see [SCF Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583).
