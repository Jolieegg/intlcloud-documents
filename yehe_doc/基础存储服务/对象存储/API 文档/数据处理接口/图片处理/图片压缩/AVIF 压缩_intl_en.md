## Feature Overview

Image compression is the process of downsizing an image as much as possible without sacrificing quality so that it can be stored at a lower cost and accessed more quickly.

COS launched the AVIF compression feature based on [CI](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1045/33422) to convert images into AVIF format, which is a brand-new image format that uses AV1 compression algorithms. It was first introduced by Netflix in February 2020 and has supported browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Restrictions

- Format: Images in JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WebP, TPG, HEIF, or other formats can be converted into AVIF.
- Size: The input image cannot be larger than 32 MB, with its width and height not exceeding 30,000 pixels, and the total number of pixels not exceeding 250 million. The width and height of the output image cannot exceed 9,999 pixels. For an input animated image, the total number of pixels (Width x Height x Number of frames) cannot exceed 250 million pixels.
- Number of frames (for animated images): For GIF, the number of frames cannot exceed 300.


## Prerequisites

To use AVIF compression, enable the image advanced compression feature for your bucket on the bucketâ€™s configuration page. For more information, see [Setting Image Advanced Compression](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40117).

## Directions

COS uses the **imageMogr2** API of CI to provide AVIF compression service.

An image can be processed:

- Upon download
- Upon upload
- In cloud

>? AVIF Compression is charged by CI at image advanced compression rates. For detailed pricing, see [Image Processing Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1045/45582).

## API Format

#### 1. Processing upon download

```plaintext
GET /<ObjectKey>?imageMogr2/format/avif HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: <GMT Date>
Authorization: <Auth String>
```

#### 2. Processing upon upload

```plaintext
PUT /<ObjectKey> HTTP/1.1

Pic-Operations: 
{
"is_pic_info": 1,
"rules": [{
    "fileid": "exampleobject",
    "rule": "imageMogr2/format/avif"
}]
}
```

>? `Pic-Operations` is a JSON string. Its parameters are as described in [Persistent Image Processing](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1045/33695).

Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Content-length: Size
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
"is_pic_info": 1,
"rules": [{
    "fileid": "exampleobject",
    "rule": "imageMogr2/format/avif"
}]
}
```

>? 
> - Authorization: Auth String (see [Request Signature](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/7778) for more information)

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ObjectKey  | Object name, such as `folder/sample.jpg`.                           |
| /format/&lt;Format> | Compression format, which is `avif`    |

## Examples

>? **Processing upon download** is used as an example here, which does not store the output image in a bucket. If you need to store the output image, use **Processing upon upload** or **Processing in-cloud data** instead.
>

Assume that the input image is a 1,335.2 KB image in PNG format, as shown below:
![img](https://example-1258125638.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.png)

You can convert the image into AVIF format using the following URL:

```plaintext
http://example-1258125638.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.png?imageMogr2/format/avif
```

**Compression ratio comparison**

| Format | Image Size |
| :---------- | :-------------------- |
| PNG (input image) | 1,335.2 KB |
| AVIF | 62.8 KB (compression ratio: 95.3%) |
