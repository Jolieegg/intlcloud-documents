## Overview

This document describes common response headers that may be used in API requests. The headers mentioned below will not be addressed again in related API documents.

## Response Headers

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Header</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">Content-Length</td>
      <td>HTTP response length in bytes as defined in RFC 2616</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">Content-Type</td>
      <td>HTTP response type (MIME) as defined in RFC 2616.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Connection</td>
      <td>Indicates whether the network connection will be turned off after the response is complete, defined in RFC 2616. Enumerated values: `keep-alive`, `close`.</td>
      <td>enum</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>Server response time in GMT format as defined in RFC 1123, such as <code>Wed, 29 May 2019 04:10:12 GMT</code>.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ETag</td>
      <td>An entity tag (ETag) identifies the object content upon creation, and can be used to check whether the object content is changed (for example: <code>"8e0b617ca298a564c3331da28dcb50df"</code>). The value of `ETag` is not necessarily the MD5 checksum of the object. The value will be different if the uploaded object is encrypted. To verify whether the object stored in the cloud is the same as the local one, you are advised to use the CRC64 value in the `x-cos-hash-crc64ecma` header.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">Last-Modified</td>
      <td>The time the object was last uploaded, e.g. <code>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:17:25 GMT</code>.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Server</td>
      <td>Name of the server that accepts the request and returns the response. Default value: <code>tencent-cos</code>.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">Transfer-Encoding</td>
      <td>Transfer encoding format as defined in RFC 2616.</ td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-hash-crc64ecma</td>
      <td>CRC64 value of the object. For more information, see [CRC64 Check](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/34078)
      <td>integer</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-request-id</td>
      <td>An ID automatically generated by the server for each request when it is sent.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-trace-id</td>
      <td>An ID automatically generated by the server for each error when a request fails. This header will be included in the response only if the request has failed.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
</table>


## Server-Side Encryption Headers

For APIs that support server-side encryption (SSE) and use SSE in the request, the following response headers will be returned according to the specific encryption method. For more information, see [Server-side Encryption Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18145).

### SSE-COS

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Header</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">x-cos-server-side-encryption</td>
      <td>If an object is uploaded with SSE-COS or an object encrypted with SSE-COS is downloaded, the request response will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload.</td>
      <td>string</td>
   </tr>
</table>

### SSE-KMS

| Header | Description | Type |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm | If an object is uploaded with SSE-C or an object encrypted with SSE-C is downloaded, the request response will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload | string |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-cos-kms-key-id | Returns the customer master key (CMK) of the Key Management Service (KMS), if not specified, the default CMK created by COS will be returned. | string |

### SSE-C

| Header | Description | Type |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm | If an object is uploaded with SSE-C or an object encrypted with SSE-C is downloaded, the request response will return this header, indicating the server-side encryption algorithm used during object upload | string |
| x-cos-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 | Base64-encoded MD5 hash of the server-side encryption key used during object upload, e.g., `U5L61r7jcwdNvT7frmUG8g==` | string |
