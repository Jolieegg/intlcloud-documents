COS provides the command-line client COSCLI to allow you to upload, download, delete, and perform other operations on COS objects by using simple commands.

COSCLI is written in Go and adopts the Cobra framework. It supports multi-bucket configurations and cross-bucket operations. You can run `./coscli [command] --help` to see how to use COSCLI.
