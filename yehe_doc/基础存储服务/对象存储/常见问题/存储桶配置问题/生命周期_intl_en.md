### How can I modify the storage class for an object?

You can modify the storage class in either of the following ways:
1. Use the console to modify the storage class of one or more objects. For detailed directions, please see [Modifying Storage Class](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30930).

2. [Set a lifecycle rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605) to transition objects in a specified bucket or prefixed with a specified value to another storage class.


### What should I do if an object I deleted still exists?

This may be caused because the object contains special characters. You can [set a lifecycle rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605) to delete it.

### Can I set an expiration time for my objects in COS?

You can set a lifecycle rule to specify the number of days to transition objects to ARCHIVE or delete them after they are uploaded. For detailed directions, please see [Setting Lifecycle](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605). You can also use an SDK to set a lifecycle (see [Android SDK - Lifecycle](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/36197) or [Java SDK - Lifecycle](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/38948)).

### Can objects be automatically cleared regularly?

You can [set a lifecycle rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605) to automatically transition objects to another storage class or delete them.

### After enabling versioning, how can I manage historical versions?

You can [set a lifecycle rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605) and enable **Managing historical versions** to transition objects or delete historical object versions.


### How many lifecycle rules can I configure?

You can configure up to 1,000 lifecycle rules for a bucket. For more information, please see [Lifecycle Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/17028).

>! It is recommended that you do not configure conflicting lifecycle rules for the same set of objects in COS, because this may result in different fees.

### When will a lifecycle rule configured take effect?

Rules configured at any time will always start executing at 00:00 the next day. As objects are executed asynchronously, the execution of qualified objects uploaded after the rule is configured will be completed before 24:00 the next day in most cases.

For example, you configured a lifecycle rule at 15:00 on the 1st day of the month to delete files one day or longer after they are modified. Then, at 00:00 on the 2nd day, the lifecycle task scans for files that were modified over one day ago and deletes them. Files uploaded on the 1st day will not be deleted at 00:00 on the 2nd day, as the time elapsed since their modification is less than one day. Instead, these files will be deleted at 00:00 on the 3rd day.

### What does “deleting incomplete multipart” mean in the lifecycle configuration?

In lifecycle configuration, **Deleting incomplete multipart** means to delete incomplete multiparts generated by multipart upload. Parts that are uploaded but not merged become incomplete multiparts, which take up storage but cannot be downloaded. You can check **Deleting incomplete multipart** as needed.
