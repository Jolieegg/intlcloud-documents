## Billing Mode

### How is COS billed?

COS supports two billing modes: pay-as-you-go (postpaid) and resource pack (prepaid). For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871).

### What are the billable items of COS?

COS billable items include [storage usage](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40099), [requests](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40100), [data retrievals](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40097), [traffic](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/33776), and [management features](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40098). For more information, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=). 


### Can I change the billing mode of COS? How do I switch from pay-as-you-go billing to resource pack deduction mode?

You don't need to manually modify the billing mode of COS. If there are resource packs under your account, they will be used for deduction first; otherwise, pay-as-you-go billing will be adopted. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871).
- If there are valid COS resource packs under your account, they will be used for deduction first, that is, **resource pack (prepaid)** billing is used.
- If there are no available COS resource packs under your account, your account balance will be used for deduction by default, that is, **pay-as-you-go (postpaid)** billing is used.

### Can COS be billed by bandwidth?

No. COS supports only two billing modes: resource pack (prepaid) and pay-as-you-go (postpaid).

### How are COS request fees calculated?

Request fees are calculated based on the number of requests sent to COS, including **user requests** and **backend requests** generated after you configure a feature. For more information, see [Request Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40100).


### What changes have been made to COS pricing?
On September 30, 2021, the published prices of COS were reduced as follows:
1. Unit price of object tagging
 - Product pricing: The prices for public cloud regions in and outside the Chinese mainland were reduced to 0.00025817 USD/10,000 tags/day and 0.0003098 USD/10,000 tags/day, respectively.
 - Billing cycle: Fees incurred between 00:00 and 23:59:59 on a day are settled the next day.
 - Bill description: These prices have taken effect for bills generated starting from October 1, 2021 (i.e., fees incurred in September until September 30, 2021).

2. Unit price of DEEP ARCHIVE read/write requests
 - Product pricing: The public cloud prices for all regions were reduced to 0.07 USD/10,000 requests.
 - Billing cycle: Fees incurred in a month are billed on the first day of the next month.
 - Bill description: These prices have taken effect for bills generated starting from October 1, 2021 (i.e., fees incurred in September).


### Which regions will benefit from the reduced unit pricing of STANDARD IA storage usage?

The reduction in the unit price of STANDARD_IA storage usage from 0.018 USD/GB/month to 0.015 USD/GB/month will apply to certain regions, including Mumbai, Seoul, Bangkok, Silicon Valley, Jakarta, and SÃ£o Paulo. The reduction has taken effect on July 1, 2022.


## Free Tier

### Does COS offer a free tier?

COS offers a limited free tier to all new users (both individual and enterprise users) to deduct the fees incurred by data stored in the **STANDARD storage class**. For more information, see [Free Tier](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6240).

### How do I check the free tier of COS?

You can view the free tier of the current account on the [Resource Packs > Free Tier](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/package/free) page in the COS console. If the page is blank, there is no available free tier. You can check whether the free tier has expired on the **Expired resource packs** page.

### Does COS offer a free tier outside the Chinese mainland?

Yes. The free tier is applicable to **public cloud regions** (including regions outside the Chinese mainland), not to finance cloud regions. For more information on regions, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224).

The free tier offered by COS can be used to deduct only **STANDARD storage usage** but not **other** billable items, such as STANDARD_IA storage usage, ARCHIVE storage usage, requests, and traffic. For more information, see [Billable Items](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40096).


### Why is my account overdue or charged even if I am on the free tier?

The following are some of the possible reasons why your account has overdue payments if your free tier hasn't expired:

1. Multiple billable items are used, but the free tier is insufficient to deduct the fees of all the billable items:
 - When you upload data to the STANDARD storage class, [storage usage fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40099) will be incurred, which can be deducted from the free tier offered by COS. COS provides multiple separately billed storage classes. The free tier of STANDARD cannot be applied to deduction of fees of other storage classes (such as STANDARD_IA).
 - Objects that need to be accessed or downloaded by other users incur [traffic](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33776) and [request](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40100) fees, which cannot be deducted from the free tier; you need to purchase a **public network downstream traffic pack** and a **data request pack** for deduction:
    - If you upload and download data between the COS bucket and CVM instance in the same region, the access is over the private network in the same region and doesn't incur traffic fees (cross-region private network access will incur cross-region traffic fees). If your data is downloaded to the local file system through the console, API, or COS tools, public network downstream traffic fees will be incurred.
    - COS offers multiple storage classes that generate different types of requests. For example, if STANDARD_IA data is downloaded, STANDARD_IA requests will be generated. Different types of requests cannot share the same request pack. Currently, only STANDARD and STANDARD_IA request packs are available, and requests for other storage classes are pay-as-you-go only.
 - If your COS bucket is used together with CDN, CDN origin-pull traffic fees may also be incurred. For more information, see [Traffic Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/33776#cos-.E4.BD.9C.E4.B8.BA-cdn-.E6.BA.90.E7.AB.99.E6.97.B6.E4.BA.A7.E7.94.9F.E7.9A.84.E6.B5.81.E9.87.8F).
 - If you enable global acceleration, global acceleration fees will also be incurred, so you need to purchase a **global acceleration traffic pack** for deduction.
2. Resource usage in excess of the free tier:
For example, if COS offers you free STANDARD storage usage of 50 GB, but your actual usage is 60 GB, the excess of 10 GB will be pay-as-you-go. To address this, you can purchase a storage pack.
3. Expiration of the free tier:
COS offers new users a free tier of STANDARD storage usage valid for six months. After the free tier expires, storage usage will be pay-as-you-go. You can log in to the COS console and go to the [Resource Packs > Free Tier](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/free) page to view the validity period of the free tier.


### Does the free tier apply to the INTELLIGENT TIERING storage class?

No. The free tier is applicable only to **STANDARD storage usage** but not **other billable items** such as STANDARD_IA/ARCHIVE storage usage, requests, and traffic.

INTELLIGENT TIERING is an independent storage class and incurs INTELLIGENT TIERING storage usage fees, which cannot be deducted from the free tier for the STANDARD storage class. You can purchase an INTELLIGENT TIERING storage pack for deduction. For more information, see [Free Tier](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6240).

### Does COS offer a free tier for CDN usage?

No. COS and CDN are different products. The CDN origin-pull traffic generated by the use of CDN is billed by COS on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the generated CDN traffic is billed by CDN. For more information on the differences between these two types of traffic, see [Traffic Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/33776#cos-.E4.BD.9C.E4.B8.BA-cdn-.E6.BA.90.E7.AB.99.E6.97.B6.E4.BA.A7.E7.94.9F.E7.9A.84.E6.B5.81.E9.87.8F).


## Resource Pack

### What is a resource pack (prepaid)?
COS supports two billing modes: pay-as-you-go (postpaid) and resource pack (prepaid). A resource pack (prepaid) is more cost-saving than pay-as-you-go billing. For more information on the supported resource pack types, see [Resource Pack (Prepaid)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54353).

### How do I purchase a resource pack?
You can purchase a resource pack as instructed in [Purchase Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54354). 

### Does the specification of a COS traffic pack refer to the monthly available amount or the total available amount for the validity period?

The specification of a traffic pack refers to the **monthly amount of traffic that can be deducted**. Fees for excess usage will be deducted from your account balance, and any amount of traffic not used in a month will not roll over to the next month. If you purchase two traffic packs with the same validity period, their specifications will be applied together every month, and fees for excess usage will be deducted from your account balance.


### Why does my account still have overdue payment or incur charges even if I purchased a storage pack?

Possible causes are as follows:

1. Multiple billable items are used, but the purchased types of resource packs are insufficient to deduct the usage of all the billable items:
 - When you upload data to COS, [data storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40099) will be generated, so you need to purchase a **storage pack** for deduction. COS provides multiple storage classes. Corresponding storage packs are available for each storage class, and the storage packs for one storage class cannot be applied to deduction of usage generated by another storage class. For example, a STANDARD storage pack cannot be applied to deduction of usage generated by the STANDARD_IA storage class.
 - Objects that need to be accessed or downloaded by other users incur [traffic](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33776) and [request](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40100) fees, so you need to purchase a **public network downstream traffic pack** and a **data request pack** for deduction:
     - If you upload and download data between the COS bucket and CVM instance in the same region, the access is over the private network in the same region and doesn't incur traffic fees (cross-region private network access will incur cross-region traffic fees). If your data is downloaded to the local file system through the console, API, or COS tools, public network downstream traffic fees will be incurred.
     - COS offers multiple storage classes that generate different types of requests. For example, if STANDARD_IA data is downloaded, STANDARD_IA requests will be generated. Different types of requests cannot share the same request pack. Currently, only STANDARD and STANDARD_IA request packs are available, and requests for other storage classes are pay-as-you-go only.
 - If your COS bucket is used together with CDN, CDN origin-pull traffic fees may also be incurred. For more information, see [Traffic Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/33776#cos-.E4.BD.9C.E4.B8.BA-cdn-.E6.BA.90.E7.AB.99.E6.97.B6.E4.BA.A7.E7.94.9F.E7.9A.84.E6.B5.81.E9.87.8F).
 - If you enable global acceleration, global acceleration fees will also be incurred, so you need to purchase a **global acceleration traffic pack** for deduction.
2. The region of the purchased resource pack is not the same as the region of your bucket, so the resource pack cannot be applied to deduction of fees:
 - You need to select a region for a resource pack when purchasing it, and a resource pack purchased for one region cannot be used for another region. For example, if you purchased a STANDARD storage pack for regions in the Chinese mainland (excluding finance cloud regions), but your data is stored in a bucket in Singapore, the bucket in Singapore will incur fees separately, which cannot be deducted from the resource pack for regions in the Chinese mainland.
 - Currently, COS only provides resource packs for **regions in the Chinese mainland** and **regions outside the Chinese mainland**, and fees incurred by buckets in other regions (such as buckets in finance cloud regions) are still pay-as-you-go. For more information on regions, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224).
3. Your data usage has exceeded the specification of the purchased resource pack:
For example, if you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 100 GB, but your actual usage is 105 GB, the excess of 5 GB will be pay-as-you-go. To address this, you can upgrade the resource pack.


### Will my usage be automatically deducted from the purchased COS resource pack? Is any additional configuration required?
Starting from the selected effective date, your usage will be automatically deducted from the purchased COS resource pack, and no additional configuration is required.

### Will other resource packs under my account be automatically used after one expires?

Yes. After a resource pack expires or is used up, other available resource packs will be automatically used for deduction first with no configuration or data migration operation required. If there are no available resource packs, fees will be deducted from your account balance by default. If your account balance becomes negative, and you fail to top up your account promptly, the services will be suspended due to overdue payment.


### Can I use multiple COS storage packs together?

Yes. Multiple COS resource packs can be used together, but only their specifications can be combined, not their validity periods. For more information on how to purchase a resource pack as well as its validity period and effective scope, see [Resource Pack (Prepaid)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54353).


### What is the difference between renewing an existing COS resource pack and purchasing a new one?

- **Renewing an existing COS resource pack** means extending the validity period of a resource pack. For example, if you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 50 GB with a validity period of three months and manually renewed it for three months, then its validity period would be extended by three months, during which you would get monthly traffic of 50 GB.
- **Purchasing a new COS resource pack** means purchasing a new and appropriate resource pack at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

>?
> - A previously purchased resource pack whose price has changed (for example, price reduction) can no longer be renewed, so you need to purchase a new one.
> - The **free** resource pack displayed on the resource pack management page cannot be renewed, so you need to purchase a new one.
> 


### Why certain COS resource packs cannot be renewed or upgraded?


In the following circumstances, resource packs cannot be renewed or upgraded, and you can purchase new resource packs at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).
1. The **free** STANDARD storage pack offered to new users cannot be renewed or upgraded (the STANDARD storage pack of 50 GB or 1 TB for all regions displayed on the resource pack management page is a free STANDARD storage pack).
2. A previously purchased resource pack whose price has changed (for example, price reduction) can no longer be renewed or upgraded, so you need to purchase a new one.
3. Storage packs can be upgraded, while traffic packs and request packs cannot. To upgrade a traffic pack or request pack, you need to purchase a new one at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=). Multiple traffic packs or request packs can be used together.

>


### How can I view the usage of my storage packs?

You can view the effective date, expiration time, and usage of purchased resource packs on the [Resource Packs > Purchased](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/package/buy) page in the **COS console**.

### Can I renew or upgrade my COS storage pack?

Yes. For detailed directions, see [Renewing a Resource Pack](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54355) and [Upgrading a Resource Pack](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54356).


### What is the difference between renewing and upgrading a COS resource pack?

**Renewing a resource pack** means extending the validity period of a resource pack.
- You can renew a resource pack if it will expire soon and you need to extend its availability.
- For example, if you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 50 GB with a validity period of three months and manually renewed it for three months, then its validity period would be extended by three months, during which you would get monthly traffic of 50 GB.

**Upgrading a resource pack** means increasing the specification of a resource pack.
- You can upgrade a resource pack if it no longer meets your actual business needs and you need a resource pack of a higher specification.
- For example, if you purchased a public network downstream traffic pack of 50 GB with a validity period of three months and upgraded it to 100 GB on the upgrade page, then it can be applied to deduction of 100 GB public network downstream traffic every month, with its validity period being unchanged.

### Can I return a COS resource pack?

Yes. A self-service refund is available for resource packs that are eligible for a refund. For more information, see [Self-Service Refund](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54353#.E8.87.AA.E5.8A.A9.E9.80.80.E8.B4.B9).


### Will my data be lost after the COS resource pack expires? Do I need to migrate the data?

No. A resource pack is only used for deduction of your usage and not for storage of data. A resource pack will be **automatically switched to the pay-as-you-go billing mode** after it is used up or expires, that is, fees will be deducted from your account balance. Therefore, your data won't be lost, and **you don't need to migrate your data**. Your data will be destroyed only if your payment is overdue for 120 days. For more information, see [Payment Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044).

### What is the relationship between a COS resource pack and a bucket?
A COS bucket is the space used to store data, while a resource pack is a prepaid mode used for deduction based on billable items and the region. There is no mapping between a resource pack and a bucket. For more information, see [Resource Pack (Prepaid)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54353).

For example, if there is a STANDARD storage pack of 50 GB for regions in the Chinese mainland with a validity period of three months under your account, it can be applied to deduction of the STANDARD storage usage generated by all buckets in regions in the Chinese mainland under your account.

### What resource pack should I purchase for deduction of fees incurred by enabling global acceleration for COS?
Traffic fees incurred by using the global acceleration feature can be deducted from a **global acceleration traffic pack**. For more information on global acceleration and its billing details, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33409).

### Will COS services be suspended after the purchased resource pack expires?

**Pay-as-you-go billing** will be adopted after your resource pack expires. If your account has overdue payment, COS services will be suspended after 24 hours. Your data will be retained for 120 days. If you fail to top up your account to a positive balance within this period, your data will be destroyed. For more information, see [Payment Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044).

### Can I migrate a COS resource pack to another Tencent Cloud account?
No. A COS resource pack cannot be migrated to another account and can only be used under the account under which it was purchased.

### Does a COS resource pack cover request fees?

Different resource pack types are available for different billable items of COS. You need to purchase a separate request pack for deduction of requests. Currently, **STANDARD request packs** and **STANDARD_IA request packs** are available and can be purchased at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

### Do I need to purchase a COS traffic pack?

You can purchase a traffic pack suitable for your actual use case. COS offers multiple billable items, and the free tier can only be applied to deduction of STANDARD storage usage. As traffic fees and request fees may also be incurred, we recommend that you purchase a **public network downstream traffic pack** and a **request pack** in advance at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

### Can a COS resource pack be applied to overdue payment?

If you configure a resource pack to **take effect immediately** when purchasing it, your usage on the day of purchase can be deducted from the resource pack, and your earlier usage will not be deducted. Therefore, a resource pack cannot be applied to overdue payment.


### How are COS resource packs applied to deduction?

COS resource packs are applied to deduction of bills as follows:
- Based on the resource pack type, the free tier will be applied before purchased resource packs. You will be charged in a pay-as-you-go manner for the usage in excess of the free tier and purchased resource packs.
- Based on the expiration time, resource packs that will expire sooner will be applied first. Note that the **expiration time here refers to the expiration time of the validity period of a resource pack, not the expiration time of its current cycle**.
- Based on the remaining usage, resource packs with more remaining usage will be applied first.
- Based on the purchase time, resource packs first purchased will be first applied.

For more information on deduction rules, see [Resource Pack Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/54353#.E8.B5.84.E6.BA.90.E5.8C.85.E7.A7.8D.E7.B1.BB).





### What is the expiration, isolation, and termination of a COS resource pack?

1. Scope of application
COS resource pack expiration, isolation, and termination policies apply only to resource packs in the list of [purchased resource packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy), not to the [free tier](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/free). You can view and confirm the category of the current resource pack on the [Resource Packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy) page in the COS console.

2. Glossary

- On the [Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal) page in the Billing Center, isolated resource packs are not displayed and cannot be renewed. To use a resource pack of the same configuration, purchase a new one at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

**Termination**: Your resource pack will be isolated one day after expiration and will be terminated after 365 days of isolation.
- On the [Resource Packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy) page in the COS console, terminated resource packs are not displayed.
- On the [Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal) page in the Billing Center, terminated resource packs are not displayed.


### Notification of change of a COS resource pack expiration/isolation/termination policy

Details are as follows:

1. Scope of application
This change of the isolation/termination policy applies only to resource packs in the list of [purchased resource packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy), not to the [free tier](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/free). You can view and confirm the category of the current resource pack on the [Resource Packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy) page in the COS console.

2. Policy description

| Policy | Before Change | After Change |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Expiration of a COS resource pack | An expiration reminder is sent before the expiration of the resource pack, and an expiration notification is sent after the expiration of the resource pack. | Both the policies for sending the expiration reminder and the expiration notification remain unchanged, and the notification text is updated. |
| Isolation of a COS resource pack | No isolation policy | A resource pack will be isolated one day after expiration. Isolated resource packs are displayed on the [Resource Packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy) page in the COS console and not displayed on the [Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal) page in the Billing Center. |
| Termination of a COS resource pack | No termination policy | A resource pack will be isolated one day after expiration and will be terminated after 365 days of isolation. Terminated resource packs are not displayed on both the [Resource Packs](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos/package/buy) page in the COS console and the [Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal) page in the Billing Center. |

3. Use cases

If you purchased a STANDARD storage pack of 10 GB with a validity period of one month on January 1, 2023, the resource pack would expire on January 31, 2023. You would receive an expiration reminder before the expiration of the resource pack and receive an expiration notification after the expiration of the resource pack.

- Before change: The resource pack will be displayed on the **Resource Packs** page in the COS console and on the **Renewal Management** page in the Billing Center after expiration, and will exist permanently.
- After change: One day after expiration, the resource pack will be isolated and will be displayed on the **Resource Packs** page in the COS console and not be displayed on the **Renewal Management** page in the Billing Center. After 365 days of isolation, the resource pack will be terminated and will not be displayed on both the **Resource Packs** page in the COS console and the **Renewal Management** page in the Billing Center.









## Notification

### What types of notifications does COS send?

COS sends notifications for new feature launch, product change, expiration, repossession, and alarms.

### What are subscribed and non-subscribed messages?

- Subscribed messages: You can customize their recipients and notification methods in Message Center. They are used in default scenarios.
- Non-subscribed messages: You cannot modify their recipients and notification methods but can only receive them passively. They are used in special scenarios.

### How do I configure the root account and sub-accounts to receive COS notifications?

You can customize the recipients of COS notifications by setting **Message Recipient** in [Subscription Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message/subscription/) in Message Center.



### What is the policy for sending reminders of exceeding COS resource packs?

Reminders are sent of exceeding all COS resource packs of the same type. Up to four reminders are triggered every month for all resource packs of the same type, regardless of their number.

Note: For example, if there are two STANDARD storage packs, one STANDARD request pack, and three public network downstream traffic packs under your account, then you have three types of resource packs; therefore, you will receive up to four reminders for each type of resource pack in a month.

For example, the system will send reminders when the usage of the three public network downstream traffic packs reaches 90% and 100%.


## Traffic


### What are the differences among COS public network downstream traffic, CDN origin-pull traffic, and global acceleration traffic?

- **Public network downstream traffic**: The traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the client over the internet, such as the traffic generated when you directly access a resource at a COS domain name in a browser, which can be deducted from a **public network downstream traffic pack**.
- **CDN origin-pull traffic**: The traffic generated by data transfer from COS to a CDN edge node when you access a CDN acceleration domain after enabling CDN acceleration.
- **Global acceleration traffic**: The traffic generated by data transfer at an acceleration endpoint through the global acceleration feature, which can be deducted from a **global acceleration traffic pack**.


### How is the public network downstream traffic in COS generated and billed?

Public network downstream traffic is the traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the client over the internet. Traffic generated by downloading an object directly through an object link or by browsing an object at a static website endpoint is public network downstream traffic. For billing details, see [Cloud Object Storage](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40096) and [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

### Will I be charged for public network downstream traffic generated by downloading files through the COS console, tools, API, or SDK?

The traffic (private or public network traffic) generated by accessing COS is subject to the use case, and only access to COS from a Tencent Cloud product in the same region will be over the private network by default, with no public network downstream traffic fees incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, see [Overview > Private Network Access](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/30613).

### What is public network traffic in COS?

Public network downstream traffic is the traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the client over the internet. Downloading a file stored in COS in the COS console, accessing or downloading an object through a tool, object address, or custom domain name, and previewing an object in a browser will generate public network downstream traffic. For more information, see [Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/30613).

### Will accessing COS over the private network incur fees?

Accessing COS over the private network will incur **storage usage fees** and **request fees** but not **traffic fees**. For billing details, see [Cloud Object Storage](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40096).

### Does COS offer traffic packs?

COS offers three types of traffic packs: **public network downstream traffic pack**, **CDN origin-pull traffic pack**, and **global acceleration traffic pack**. **Public network downstream traffic packs** are most used, and traffic fees will be incurred only after the corresponding feature is enabled for the latter two. You can purchase traffic packs at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=). For more information on traffic fees, see [Traffic Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33776).

### How will COS be billed after it is connected to CDN?

After COS is connected to CDN, the fees incurred by COS and CDN will be billed separately.

- COS fees include storage usage fees, request fees, and CDN origin-pull traffic fees. You can purchase COS resource packs at [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).
- CDN fees include CDN traffic fees.



### Why is there public network downstream traffic after I enabled CDN acceleration?

It may be because you are still using the COS origin domain name formatted as `<BucketName-APPID>.cos.<region>.myqcloud.com` to access COS files after you enabled CDN acceleration. We recommend that you use the CDN acceleration domain name instead, which only generates CDN origin-pull traffic.


### What is CDN origin-pull traffic in COS? How is it generated?

CDN origin-pull is to pull data from COS to the cache node by CDN when a file not cached on a CDN edge node is accessed at a CDN domain name.

>? CDN origin-pull will incur origin-pull traffic fees. For more information, see [Traffic Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/33776#cos-.E4.BD.9C.E4.B8.BA-cdn-.E6.BA.90.E7.AB.99.E6.97.B6.E4.BA.A7.E7.94.9F.E7.9A.84.E6.B5.81.E9.87.8F).
>

### How is the CDN origin-pull traffic billed in COS?

CDN origin-pull traffic is the traffic generated by data transfer from COS to a CDN edge node. After CDN acceleration is enabled, traffic generated by browsing or downloading COS data in the client at a **CDN acceleration domain name** is CDN origin-pull traffic. For billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871) and [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

### What are the differences between CDN origin-pull traffic and CDN traffic?

CDN origin-pull traffic is a billable item in COS. It is the origin-pull traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the CDN edge node when COS is used as the CDN origin.

CDN traffic is a billable item in CDN. It is the traffic generated by data transfer from a CDN edge node to the client.



### Will fees be charged for traffic and requests generated by data transfer between COS and CVM?

When data transfer happens between COS and CVM from different regions, there are charges for both traffic and requests. When data is transferred in the same region, there are charges for requests, but not for traffic (free for data transfer over private network). For more information, see [How to determine access over private network](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/30613).


### Will there be traffic fees when I upload a file to a COS bucket?

No. The upstream traffic generated by file uploads is free of charge.

### Will there be traffic fees when I access Tencent Cloud products in the same region?

Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default, with no traffic fees incurred. For more information, see [How to determine an access over private network](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/30613).


## Bill

[](id:type)

### What are billing by bucket and cost allocation by tag?

- Billing by bucket: It refers to using the bucket name and `APPID` together as the **resource ID** and using the bucket name as the **instance name**, i.e., generating bills by bucket. You can view the fees and usage of billable items by bucket.
- Cost allocation by tag: You can specify **[cost allocation tags](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/32276)** to differentiate resources by category.


[](id:set)
### How do I set billing by bucket and cost allocation by tag?

COS supports billing by bucket and cost allocation by tag.
- Billing by bucket: Contact your sales rep to add your account to the allowlist of the billing by bucket feature. This feature will take effect for new bills the next day after approval, while historical bills will remain unchanged.
- Cost allocation by tag: Tag your buckets, set cost allocation tags, and contact your sales rep to add your account to the allowlist of the billing by bucket feature.

>? 
>After your account is added to the allowlist, billing by bucket will take effect only for new bills, while existing bills will remain unchanged. In addition, you cannot go back to the previous billing option.

[](id:judge)
### How do I determine whether bills are generated by bucket?

You can determine this in two ways:

- Option 1: Select **Billing Center** > **[Billing Details](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/summary)** and view **Bill by Instance** and **Bill Details**. If the **Resource Alias/ID** is a bucket name and APPID, billing by bucket has been enabled.
- Option 2: Select **Billing Center** > **[Bill Download Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/downloadCenter)** and download bill details (L3). If the **Resource ID** is a bucket name and APPID and **Instance Name** is a bucket name, billing by bucket has been enabled.

Below are the effects after billing by bucket is enabled:

(1) Bill by instance

Note: After the billing by bucket feature of COS is fully launched, on the **Cost Allocation - Month** sheet in the usage details, the bucket cost allocation information won't be displayed, while other information stays unchanged. For specific bucket fees, download the L2 or L3 bill.



### How is the billing by bucket feature of COS launched?

The billing by bucket feature of COS was made available through an allowlist starting from October 28, 2022 as follows:
- If you had applied to add your UIN to the allowlist of the billing by bucket feature, the **Resource ID** and **Instance Name** columns in the bill would change, where the **Resource ID** is a bucket name + `APPID` and **Instance Name** is a bucket name.
- If you hadn't applied to add your UIN to the allowlist of the billing by bucket feature, billing would stay unchanged.

Starting from February 1, 2023, the feature was **made available to users in batches by UIN** as follows:

| Launch Date | Description | Bill Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| October 28, 2022 | Feature launch - through allowlist. | (1) Billing stayed unchanged for users not in the allowlist. (2) Billing by bucket was enabled for users in the allowlist. |

[](id:period)
### How do I view the billing statistical period?

Log in to the Tencent Cloud console, select **Billing Center** > **[Bill Overview](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/overview)**, and view the billing statistical period of your account.


[](id:charge)
### What are billing by deduction cycle and billing by billing cycle?

- Billing by deduction cycle: The system generates a bill per calendar month based on the **resource fees deduction time**.
- Billing by billing cycle: The system generates a bill per calendar month based on the **actual resource usage time**.

[](id:relationship)
### What is the relationship between the billing mode and billing statistical period?

COS supports two billing modes: pay-as-you-go (postpaid) and resource pack (prepaid).

- Pay-as-you-go (postpaid) resources
  - Daily settled resources: Fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on January 31 will be deducted on February 1. The record will be posted to the bill for February by deduction cycle and to the bill for January by billing cycle.
  - Monthly settled resources: Fees incurred from 00:00 on January 1 to 23:59 on January 31 will be deducted on February 1. The record will be posted to the bill for February by deduction cycle and to the bill for January by billing cycle.

- Resource pack (prepaid)
Resource packs (purchase, renewal, upgrade/downgrade, termination, and refund) are recorded in the bills for the calendar month in which the fees were incurred, regardless of the deduction or billing cycle.

For more information on billing cycles, see [Bill Management](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/7430).

[](id:costMore)
### Why did the amount of the bill (by deduction cycle) of the first month âincreaseâ after the upgrade from monthly to daily settlement?

Starting from July 1, 2022, the settlement cycle of COS storage usage, request, and data retrieval fees was upgraded from monthly to daily to help you manage fees in a more refined manner. The upgrade was implemented on user accounts in batches and went through a two-month beta test. The release dates of different bill statistical periods are as listed below. For more information, see [Daily Billing for COS Storage Usage, Request, and Data Retrieval](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/47593) and [Bills](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/7432).

| Release Date                               | Release Note                          | Bill Description                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| July 1, 2022 | The first release for the first batch of accounts in beta test | (1) Resources were settled monthly before July 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 on June 1 to 23:59 on June 30 were deducted on July 1. The record was posted to the bill for July by deduction cycle and to the bill for June by billing cycle. <br> (2) Resources were settled daily after July 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on July 1 were deducted on July 2. The record was posted to the bill for July 2 by deduction cycle and to the bill for July 1 by billing cycle. |
| August 1, 2022 | The second release for the second batch of accounts in beta test | (1) Resources were settled monthly before August 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 on July 1 to 23:59 on July 31 were deducted on August 1. The record was posted to the bill for August by deduction cycle and to the bill for July by billing cycle. <br> (2) Resources were settled daily after August 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on August 1 were deducted on August 2. The record was posted to the bill for August 2 by deduction cycle and to the bill for August 1 by billing cycle. |
| September 1, 2022 | The third release for all accounts | (1) Resources were settled monthly before September 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 on August 1 to 23:59 on August 31 were deducted on September 1. The record was posted to the bill for September by deduction cycle and to the bill for August by billing cycle. <br> (2) Resources were settled daily after September 1, 2022. Fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on September 1 were deducted on September 2. The record was posted to the bill for September 2 by deduction cycle and to the bill for September 1 by billing cycle. |

Therefore, if the monthly usage remained the same, after monthly settlement was upgraded to daily settlement, the bill amount varied by billing statistical period and billable items as follows:
- Billing by billing cycle: The monthly fees of storage usage, requests, and data retrievals remain basically unchanged after the upgrade.
- Billing by deduction cycle: The monthly fees of storage usage increase after the upgrade, while the monthly fees of requests and data retrievals remain basically unchanged after the upgrade.

In the first month after the upgrade from monthly settlement to daily settlement, the storage fees increased. This was because two bills were generated for billing by deduction cycle. The first bill was the monthly bill for the last month, while the second bill was the daily bill for the current month. Therefore, the bill amount seemed to have increased, but no additional fees were deducted in fact, which was normal under the settlement and billing logic.

In the second month after the upgrade from monthly settlement to daily settlement, your bills were settled daily, and the bill amount "decreased" compared with that in the first month, which was also normal under the settlement and billing logic.

For example:
Your account is billed by deduction cycle and was upgraded from monthly settlement to daily settlement on September 1, 2022, and you downloaded the **bill details (L3)** of COS in the [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/summary) on September 30.

Taking the **COS STANDARD storage usage** billable item as an example, the bills consisted of the monthly bill for August and daily bill for September as detailed below:
 - Pay-as-you-go monthly settlement: The monthly bill was generated on September 1 for resource usage fees incurred in the entire August (from 00:00 on August 1 to 23:59 on August 31).
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/e33e62685abec6f26131da286b669b38.png)
 - Pay-as-you-go daily settlement: After the upgrade from monthly settlement to daily settlement on September 1, a daily bill was generated on each day starting from September 2 for daily resource usage fees incurred in the entire September. The bill generated on September 2 was for fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on September 1, that on September 3 was for fees incurred from 00:00 to 23:59 on September 2, and so on.
As there was too much bill data, only the daily bills for September 2â3 are listed below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/ac2d710670f781a8f90979e2515096b4.png)

Therefore, if your monthly fees increased in the first month after the upgrade from monthly settlement to daily settlement and your bill was generated by deduction cycle, the increase was normal under the settlement and billing logic, and no additional fees were deducted in fact. If you have any questions, [contact us](https://www.tencentcloud.com/contact-sales) for assistance.


### Why are there daily and monthly settlement modes in the transaction details?

Before the upgrade, COS' storage, requests, STANDARD_IA data retrievals, and ARCHIVE data retrievals are settled monthly, and their monthly settlement details are displayed in the transaction details, while DEEP ARCHIVE data retrievals, traffic, and management features are still settled daily, and their daily settlement details are still displayed in the transaction details. After the upgrade, all COS billable items are settled daily. For more information, see [Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871#.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E5.91.A8.E6.9C.9F).

In addition, you can view the L3 bill to check whether the billable items are settled daily or monthly as instructed in [Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10373).


## Fee Deduction

### Will I be charged immediately after activating COS?

Activating COS is free of charge, and fees will be incurred only after you use it. For billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/16871).

If you upload multiple files in a total size of 1 GB to the STANDARD storage class after activating COS and then view and download them, STANDARD storage, write requests, public/private network upstream traffic, and public network downstream traffic (of about 1 GB) will be generated, and the bill generated on the next day will include the STANDARD storage, STANDARD write request, and public network downstream traffic fees. As the public/private network upstream traffic is free of charge, it will not be included in the bill.

### Will file uploads to COS incur fees?

When you upload a file to COS, the generated **traffic is free of charge**, but the generated **write request** will incur fees, and the **storage usage fees** will be calculated based on the file size. If you access or download the object over the public network, public network downstream traffic fees will be incurred. For billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/16871) and [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=).

### Why is my account charged even if I am on the free tier?

If your account is charged even if you have a free tier (STANDARD storage pack), possible causes are as follows:
- Scenario 1: In addition to STANDARD storage usage, **other billable items such as read/write requests and public network downstream traffic** are also generated. As such billable items cannot be deducted from the STANDARD storage pack, they are billed in a pay-as-you-go manner.
- Scenario 2: The specification of your free tier (STANDARD storage pack) is smaller than your actual storage usage. For example, if the specification of your free tier is 50 GB and your actual STANDARD storage usage is 100 GB, the excess of 50 GB will be pay-as-you-go.
- Scenario 3: Your free tier (STANDARD storage pack) has expired, and your STANDARD storage usage will be pay-as-you-go.

For more information, see [Why is my account overdue or charged even if I am on the free tier?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10373).  

### Why are fees still deducted after my data in COS is deleted?

If you no longer use the COS service, you need to delete all the buckets under your account. Double check whether **all the buckets have been deleted**. If fees are still incurred after all the buckets are deleted, they may be **the daily fees incurred on the previous day**. COS storage usage fees and request fees are billed daily, that is, a bill generated on the current day is for usage on the previous day. You can go to the [transaction details](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/transactions) page and click **Details** on the right of a billable item to view fee deduction details.

The details about the change from monthly settlement to daily settlement are as follows: Starting from July 1, 2022, the settlement cycle of COS storage usage, request, and data retrieval fees was upgraded from monthly to daily to help you manage fees in a more refined manner. The upgrade was implemented on user accounts in batches and went through a two-month beta test. The release dates of different bill statistical periods are as listed below. For more information, see [Daily Billing for COS Storage Usage, Request, and Data Retrieval](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/47593) and [Bills](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/7432).


### How do I deactivate the COS service and stop being charged?

You can deactivate COS or stop its billing as follows:

1. If you decide to stop using COS, you can avoid any further billing by permanently deleting all of your COS data (including incomplete multipart uploads and object versions) as instructed in [How do I deactivate the COS service and stop being charged?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044#guide). There is no need to remove your account, and if you use other Tencent Cloud products, avoid doing so as it will affect your other services.
2. If you don't use COS for more than one month, you can set lifecycle rules to transition data in STANDARD storage class in the bucket to a colder class such as STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, or DEEP ARCHIVE to reduce storage fees. For more information, see [Setting Lifecycle](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14605). The transition will generate read requests in the original storage class and write requests in the target storage class, so transition by lifecycle will incur read/write [request fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40100).


**Notes**

- Data, once deleted from the bucket, cannot be recovered, so make backups accordingly.
- If versioning is enabled for the bucket, disable it before deleting data.
- Check your billing cycle to avoid overdue payments. If all your billable items are settled daily, the bill for the day of data deletion will be generated on the next day. After the data is completely cleared, the system will stop billing. For more information, see [Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871#.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E5.91.A8.E6.9C.9F).
- If your account has overdue payment (i.e., your account balance is below 0), COS services will be suspended after 24 hours, regardless of whether your resource pack is within the validity period.
- If your account has overdue payment and COS services are suspended, the free tier for which your account is eligible won't be available.
- If data in your bucket is blocked for the second time due to non-compliance, it cannot be deleted. [Contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales) if you have any questions. 


### How will I be charged when storing data in STANDARD_IA for less than 30 days?

The minimum data storage duration in STANDARD_IA storage class is 30 days.

Below are the specific rules:
- An object stored less than 30 days is billed by 30 days as described in [Storage Usage Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40099#.E5.85.B3.E4.BA.8E.E6.8F.90.E5.89.8D.E5.88.A0.E9.99.A4.E7.9A.84.E8.AF.B4.E6.98.8E).
- An object stored more than 30 days is billed by the actual storage duration.

For more information, see "STANDARD_IA storage usage fees" and "Billing Mode and Calculation Formula" in [Storage Usage Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40099#.E4.BD.8E.E9.A2.91.E5.AD.98.E5.82.A8.E5.AE.B9.E9.87.8F.E8.B4.B9.E7.94.A8).

- An object stored more than 90 days is billed by the actual storage duration.

For more information, see "ARCHIVE storage usage fees" and "Billing Mode and Calculation Formula" in [Storage Usage Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40099#.E5.BD.92.E6.A1.A3.E5.AD.98.E5.82.A8.E5.AE.B9.E9.87.8F.E8.B4.B9.E7.94.A8).



### How will I be charged when storing data in DEEP ARCHIVE for less than 180 days?

The minimum data storage duration in DEEP ARCHIVE storage class is 180 days.

Below are the specific rules:
- An object stored less than 180 days is billed by 180 days as described in [Storage Usage Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40099#.E5.85.B3.E4.BA.8E.E6.8F.90.E5.89.8D.E5.88.A0.E9.99.A4.E7.9A.84.E8.AF.B4.E6.98.8E).
- An object stored more than 180 days is billed by the actual storage duration.

For more information, see "DEEP ARCHIVE storage usage fees" and "Billing Mode and Calculation Formula" in [Storage Usage Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40099#.E6.B7.B1.E5.BA.A6.E5.BD.92.E6.A1.A3.E5.AD.98.E5.82.A8.E5.AE.B9.E9.87.8F.E8.B4.B9.E7.94.A8).



### What are data retrieval fees in COS?

Data retrieval fees are fees incurred by reading or downloading **MAZ_STANDARD_IA/STANDARD_IA** data or restoring **ARCHIVE** or **DEEP ARCHIVE** data to STANDARD. They are calculated based on the amount of retrieved data. The higher the amount, the higher the fees. If you don't have special storage needs, you can directly use STANDARD, which doesn't involve data retrieval fees.


### What fees will be incurred by copying MAZ_STANDARD_IA/STANDARD_IA data?

Copying MAZ_STANDARD_IA/STANDARD_IA data will incur request fees and data retrieval fees and may also incur cross-region replication traffic fees if the destination and source files are in different regions.

For the calculation details of such fees, see [Request Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40100), [Data Retrieval Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40097#.E4.BD.8E.E9.A2.91.E5.AD.98.E5.82.A8.EF.BC.88.E5.A4.9A-az.EF.BC.89.2F.E4.BD.8E.E9.A2.91.E5.AD.98.E5.82.A8.E6.95.B0.E6.8D.AE.E5.8F.96.E5.9B.9E.E8.B4.B9.E7.94.A8), and [Traffic Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/33776).


### Will I be charged for a copy generated by restoring ARCHIVE or DEEP ARCHIVE data in COS?

A copy generated by restoring ARCHIVE or DEEP ARCHIVE data is in the **STANDARD** storage class and will incur STANDARD storage usage fees.

### How will I be charged for less than 10,000 read/write requests?

The read/write requests are priced by storage class and billed based on the actual quantity, with a minimum billable quantity of 10,000. For more information, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos?lang=en&pg=) and [Request Fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/436/40100#.E8.AF.BB.E5.86.99.E8.AF.B7.E6.B1.82.E8.B4.B9.E7.94.A8).


### Why are the COS read/write request fees zero?

If the number of requests does not reach the minimum value for fee deduction, the request fees will be zero.

Case study: If 23 STANDARD read requests for your data stored in the STANDARD storage class in a bucket in Beijing region were made in December 2021, the unit price of STANDARD read/write requests was 0.002 USD/10,000 requests, and your account wasn't entitled to any discount, then the STANDARD read request fees were 0.0023 \* 0.002 = 0.0000046 USD. As fee deduction is accurate down to two decimal places, your request fees for the month were 0 USD.

Cause: As bills support eight decimal places at most, while fee deduction is accurate down to two decimal places, the system will automatically adjust the accuracy difference. For more information, see [Bills](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/7465).




## Overdue Payment and Service Suspension

### Can I still access and download files in the COS console if my COS service is suspended due to overdue payment?

After the COS service is suspended due to overdue payment, you cannot read or write data from or to COS, but you can top up your account. For more information, see [Payment Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044).

### Why can't I use the COS service after topping up my account to a positive balance?

Your account will be automatically unblocked in 10 minutes after it is topped up. If your account is still displayed as blocked, the browser may have cached the historical page. In this case, we recommend you **refresh the webpage** or **clear the browser cache** first.


## Data Processing

### How is the PowerPoint-to-image conversion in COS' document processing service billed? Will fees be incurred if I access an object that I have accessed before?

The document processing service is offered by CI, so its fees are also charged by CI. Fees will be incurred for every request; that is, fees will be deducted every time you refresh the URL. For more information, see [Document Processing Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49490).
