## Background

If you are using COS and need to migrate data in a bucket within COS, you are advised to use either of the following migration methods:

- Online migration: [Migration Service Platform (MSP)](#msp)
- Online migration: [Cross-bucket replication](#replication)



## Migration Practice

<span id="msp">

#### MSP

MSP is a platform that integrates multiple migration tools and provides a visual interface to help you easily monitor and manage large-scale data migration tasks. The "File Migration Tool" can help you migrate data from various public clouds and data origin servers to COS.

The steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the [MSP console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/msp).
2. Click **Object Storage Migration** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Create a Task** to create a task and configure the task as needed.
4. Start the task.

For more information, please see [Migrating Between Tencent Cloud COS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1036/33184).

During data migration, how fast the source data can be read depends on the network, and selecting a higher QPS concurrence when creating a file migration task will speed up the migration.

#### Cross-Bucket replication

COS introduces the cross-bucket replication feature, with which you can set a rule to automatically and asynchronously replicate **incremental objects** in buckets residing in different regions. If cross-bucket replication is enabled, COS will precisely replicate object content (for example, object metadata and version ID) in the source bucket to the destination bucket, where the replicaâ€™s attributes will be identical to those of the source. Moreover, operations on the source objects, for example, object upload and object deletion, will also be replicated to the destination bucket.
