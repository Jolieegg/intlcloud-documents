## Overview
A cloud disk is an expandable storage device on cloud. You can expand its capacity at any time without losing any data in it.
After expanding the cloud disk, you need to expand the partitions and file systems. You can allocate the capacity of the expanded part to an existing partition or format it into a new partition.


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
MBR partition supports a disk with a maximum capacity of 2 TB. If you need to extend for over 2 TB, we recommend you create and attach a new data disk and use the GPT partition format.
</dx-alert>


## Expanding Data Disks
To expand a data disk, the following three methods are provided.


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
If multiple cloud disks of the same capacity and type are attached to the CVM, you can identify them using the method shown in [Distinguishing data disks](#distinguish). Select a data disk and expand its capacity as instructed below.
</dx-alert>



<dx-tabs>
::: Expand in the CVM console (recommended)[](id:useCVMConsole)
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. Select **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Expand Cloud Disks** in the **Operation** column.
3. Select the data disk to be expanded in the pop-up window, and click **Next**.
4. Select a new capacity, which must be greater than or equal to the current capacity, and click **Next**.
5. Read the notes and click **Adjust Now**.

6. Assign its expanded capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition. Depending on the operating system of the CVM, see [Extending Partitions and File Systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) or [Determining the Expansion Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995).
:::
::: Expand in the CBS console[](id:useCBSConsole)
1. Log in to the [CBS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cbs).
2. Select **More** > **Expand** for the target cloud disk.
3. Select a new capacity. It must be greater than or equal to the current capacity.
4. Complete the payment.
5. Assign its expanded capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition. Depending on the operating system of the CVM, see [Extending Partitions and File Systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) or [Determining the Expansion Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995).
:::
::: Expand via API[](id:useAPI)
You can use the `ResizeDisk` API to expand the specified cloud disks. For more information, see [ResizeDisk](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/16310).

## Expanding System Disks[](id:useCVMconsole)
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index). Locate the target CVM, and select **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Expand Cloud Disks** in the **Operation** column.
2. Select the system disk to be expanded in the pop-up window, and click **Next**.
3. Select a new capacity, which must be greater than or equal to the current capacity, and click **Next**.
4. Expand the cloud disk as instructed below.
<dx-tabs>
::: Offline expansion
1. Read the notes, select **Agree to a forced shutdown**, and click **Adjust Now**.

2. After the expansion is completed on the console, check the cloudinit configuration for [Linux instances](#confirmLinuxConfig) or [Windows instances](#confirmwindowsConfig) according to the operating system of the CVM. Then expand partitions and file systems as needed.

:::
::: Online expansion
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
CVM supports online capacity expansion for cloud disk serving as system disk, i.e., non-stop capacity expansion. To use this feature, [submit a ticket](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.
</dx-alert>
 1. Read the notes and click **Adjust Now**.

 2. Complete the capacity expansion in the console and log in to the instance to check whether the file system has been extended automatically. If not, extend the partition and file system as instructed in [Extending System Disk and File System Online](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/50063).

### Distinguishing data disks[](id:distinguish)
Check cloud disks according to the operating system of the CVM.
<dx-tabs>
::: Linux
1. [Log in to a Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436).
2. Run the following command to view the relationship between the elastic cloud disks and the device name.
```
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id
â€‹```The following information will appear:

### Checking the cloudinit configuration
Check cloud disks according to the operating system of the CVM.
<dx-tabs>
::: Checking the cloudinit configuration for Linux instances[](id:confirmLinuxConfig)
After the system disk is expanded, [log in to the Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436) and check whether the `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` file contains the `growpart` and `resizefs` configuration items.
 - If yes, ignore other operations.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/03d38f34651d317176c50f1ed3a03f30.png)
    - **growpart**: Expands the partition to the disk size.
    - **resizefs**: Expands or adjusts the file system in the `/` partition to the partition size.
 - If no, manually [extend partitions and file systems of the Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995), and assign its extended capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition.
:::
::: Checking the cloudinit configuration for Windows instances[](id:confirmwindowsConfig)
After the system disk is expanded, [log in to the Windows instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5435) and check whether the `ExtendVolumesPlugin` configuration item exists under `plugin` in `C:\Program Files\Cloudbase Solutions\Cloudbase-Init\conf\cloudbase-init.conf`.
 - If yes, ignore other operations.
 - If no, manually [extend partitions and file systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) according to the operating system, and assign its extended capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition.
