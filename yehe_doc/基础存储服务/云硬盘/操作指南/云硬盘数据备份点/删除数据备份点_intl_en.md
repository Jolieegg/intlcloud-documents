## Overview

For cloud disks with the data backup point quota configured, Tencent Cloud will automatically create and manage a data backup point for data backup, so that the backed up data can stay up to date. For more information, see [Data Backup Point Quota of Cloud Disk](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/50030#quota).

The data backup point is free of charge, and retaining it doesn't incur fees. This document describes how to delete the data backup point.

Deleting the data backup point cannot be undone, and deleted data backups cannot be recovered.
