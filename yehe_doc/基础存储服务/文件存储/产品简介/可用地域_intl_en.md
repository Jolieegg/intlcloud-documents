The following table describes regions where CFS is available:

>! If you need to use CFS in a region where resources are sold out for your CVM instances or services, you can choose a VPC in that region, create a subnet in a purchasable availability zone (AZ), and then create a CFS file system in that subnet. For more information, please see [FAQs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/9551).
