## Overview

This document describes how to receive alarm notifications via SMS and phone.

## Use Limits

We recommend that you set to receive only urgent alarms via phone, as the number of alarms that can be received in this manner is limited as follows:
- A mobile number can receive up to **one** alarm per 30 seconds, up to **three** alarms per 10 minutes, and up to **50** alarms per day.
- A mobile number can receive up to **three** alarms between 10:00 PM and 8:00 AM.

The above limits apply to not only phone alarm notifications generated by CLS and are also shared by those generated by CM and Message Center.
