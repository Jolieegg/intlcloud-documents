## Overview

CLS manages the log data stored on it in the form of log topics and logsets. A log topic is the basic unit for log data collection, storage, search, and analysis, and a logset is used to categorize log topics for easier management.

This document describes how to manage logsets in the console. We recommend you read [Log Topic and Logset](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32849) first to learn more about concepts and use cases.
