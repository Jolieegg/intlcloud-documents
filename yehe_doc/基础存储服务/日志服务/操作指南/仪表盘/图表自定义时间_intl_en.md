## Overview

Dashboard charts support custom time.

In addition to custom time, global dashboard time is also supported, which is used by default when a dashboard chart is created and determines the data scope of the chart. If the global dashboard time changes, the time ranges of all the associated charts will change.

After a custom time is configured, the chart time becomes independent and doesn't change as the global time changes. In the dashboard, different charts can use different times to support more diversified comparisons.
