A bar chart describes categorical data. It visually reflects the comparison of each category in size. It is suitable for category statistics scenarios, for example, collecting the numbers of each type of error codes in the last 24 hours.

If there are too many statistical results, the bars/columns will be too dense and labels will overlap each other as shown above, which will affect the analysis. In this case, you can hover over the chart and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in/out the displayed area. This allows you to focus on the local content and display the complete information.
