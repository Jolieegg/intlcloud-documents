## Overview

To help you use CLS more efficiently, we have developed an SDK (available in multiple languages) for you to upload logs to CLS.

## Notes

1. The SDK encapsulates the data access APIs of CLS and is available in multiple languages, making it easier for you to upload logs.
2. The SDK supports the ProtoBuffer format. You don’t need to pay attention to format details when uploading logs.
3. The SDK supports the compression method defined in CLS APIs. You don’t need to pay attention to compression details. For some languages, the SDK supports uploading compressed logs (the default mode).
4. In addition to log upload, the SDK offers features including async sending, resource control, auto retry, graceful shutdown, and exception log reporting.
