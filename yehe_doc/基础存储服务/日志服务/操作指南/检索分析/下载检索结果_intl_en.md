2. Perform a search with the [search syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/30439).

## Notes

- By default, the search result list displays 20 logs for the first search. To download more, just pull down the list to load new logs, and then click the download icon again.
- Logs are downloaded in CSV format and named as `logset name_log topic name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`.
