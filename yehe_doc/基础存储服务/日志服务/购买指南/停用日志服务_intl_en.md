## How can I disable the CLS service and stop being charged?

There is no one-click option for disabling CLS. If you decide to stop using CLS, you can avoid any further billing by permanently deleting all of your CLS resources such as log topics. There is no need to de-register your account, and if you use other Tencent Cloud products, avoid doing so as it will affect your other services.

CLS is pay-as-you-go. You can query the billing information about related resources the day after you delete them. As shown below, you can view the bill generated on September 15 on September 16:
