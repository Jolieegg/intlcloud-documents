## Service status in case of overdue payment

1. The CLS service will be automatically suspended once your account has an overdue payment. You should top up your account to a positive balance to avoid affecting your business.
2. You cannot read or write any data in CLS, while charges will still be incurred for the **storage usage of your data** until it is destroyed. Before the destruction, CLS will retain your data for 15 days. During this period, all you can do in the console is to pay charges. After you top up your account to a positive balance, the service will be resumed automatically.
3. After 15 days, you will be deemed to have waived the CLS service. With no promise to further retention, you data will be destroyed and cannot be recovered.


## How to avoid or process overdue payment

1. If you no longer use the data stored in CLS, delete it to avoid incurring further fees.
2. You can enable the **cost alert** feature in the **Console** > **Billing Center**. An alert notification will be sent to you when your available balance drops below the alert threshold. For more information, see [Balance Alerts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9942).
3. When your account has an overdue payment, top up your account to a positive balance promptly. You can check your [bills](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/overview) in the Billing Center.
