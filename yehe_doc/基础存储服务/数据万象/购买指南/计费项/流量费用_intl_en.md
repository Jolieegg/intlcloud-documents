### Traffic generated after CDN acceleration is enabled

When you access CI at COS domain names with CI data processing parameters or at CI domain names, if you enable the CDN acceleration domain name and **download data** through it, the following fees will be incurred:

| Billable Item | Description | Billed By |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| CDN origin-pull traffic | Origin-pull traffic generated by data transfer from CI to CDN edge servers                | CI    |
| CDN traffic     | CDN outbound traffic generated by data download from CDN edge servers to local systems or clients    | CDN |
| COS request | COS requests made during data transfer from CI to CDN edge servers as data is stored in COS | COS |

**Example:**

A. When you access a COS domain name with image processing parameters to request adjusting the width and height of an image to 50% of the original values, the following fees will be incurred:
