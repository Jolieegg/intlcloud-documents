## Billing Example

Suppose you upload a batch of images to a bucket, use CI's image cropping and advanced compression features to process the images in real time, and add blind watermarks during upload.

Usage statistics show that the basic image processing usage is 5 TB, the advanced compression feature is used 10,000 times, and the blind watermark feature is used 10,000 times.

The following can be concluded:

| Item | Free Tier | Unit Price | Billable Usage | Fees (Unit Price * Billable Usage) |
| :--------------- | :------- | :------------- | :------- | :------------------ |
| Basic image processing | 10 TB     | 0.01 USD/GB/month | 0 GB      | 0 USD               |
| Image advanced compression | None       | 0.015 USD/1,000 times | 10,000 times | 0.015 * 10 = 0.15 USD   |
| Blind watermark       | None       | 0.15 USD/1,000 times  | 10,000 times | 0.15 * 10 = 1.5 USD     |
| **Monthly fees**       | -        | -              | -        | **1.65 USD**        |
