### What are the billable items of CI?

The billable items of CI include [image processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/45582), [media processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49489), [file processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49490), and [traffic fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49491).




## Traffic

### How is the public network downstream traffic in CI generated and billed?

Public network downstream traffic is the traffic generated by data transfer from CI to the client over the internet. Traffic generated by downloading an object directly through an object link or by browsing an object at a static website endpoint is public network downstream traffic. For billing details, see [Traffic Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49491).

### Will downloading files through the CI console, tools, API, or SDK incur public network downstream traffic fees?

The traffic (private or public network traffic) generated by accessing CI is subject to the use case, and only access to CI from a Tencent Cloud product in the same region will be over the private network by default with no public network downstream traffic fees incurred.
