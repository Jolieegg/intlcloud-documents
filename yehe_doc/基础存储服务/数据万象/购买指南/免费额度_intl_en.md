## Claim and Query

- After you activate and use CI's basic image processing service, the system will automatically issue a free tier resource pack to your account, which will be valid for one month.
- For other services, the system will automatically issue a free tier resource pack when you use a service for the first time, which will be valid for two months.
- **The free tier will be issued to your account in the form of free resource packs**. You can view their effective date and expiration date on the [Resource Pack Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ci/package) page in the console.



## Validity Period

The **free tier** for the basic image processing service is valid for one calendar month.

The **free tier** for other services is valid for two calendar months.

For example, if you activate and use CI's basic image processing service at 05:13:14 PM on March 10, 2021, the effective month of the free resource pack starts from March 1, 2021, and the free tier is valid between March 1, 2021 and March 30, 2021.



## Billing Sequence

During the free tier term, you may still be charged for other fees, such as advanced compression and traffic fees. Therefore, the billing sequence varies by scenario.

Take basic image processing as an example:

- By default, the system adopts the **pay-as-you-go** billing mode for bill settlement.
- If you are eligible for the free tier, then your bills will be settled in the order of **free tier** > **pay-as-you-go billing**, that is, you will be charged in a pay-as-you-go manner for the usage in excess of the free tier.
