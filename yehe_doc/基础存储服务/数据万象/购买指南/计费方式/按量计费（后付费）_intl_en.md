## Billing Cycle
CI billable items are billed **monthly**. Amounts are deducted and the bill for the previous month is generated on the first day of each month.

## Samples

You operate an online image website. Visitors can upload their local images to the website for online image processing and then download the output images. You store the website content in a COS bucket in **Guangzhou region**, use the **CI** service, and enable the CDN acceleration service.

The monthly basic image processing volume is 100 GB, generating CDN origin-pull traffic of 100 GB, Guetzli compression operations of 10,000 times, and blind watermark operations of 10,000 times.
