## Feature Overview

CI uses the **imageMogr2/grayscale** API to set an image to be a grayscale image.

## API Sample

#### 1. Processing during download

```plaintext
GET /<ObjectKey>?imageMogr2/grayscale/<value> HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: <GMT Date>
Authorization: <Auth String>
```

#### 2. Processing during upload

```plaintext
PUT /<ObjectKey> HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/grayscale/<value>"
  }]
}
```

>? `Pic-Operations` is a JSON string. Its parameters are as described in [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695).
>

#### 3. Processing in-cloud data

```plaintext
POST /<ObjectKey>?image_process HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Content-length: Size
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
  "is_pic_info": 1,
  "rules": [{
      "fileid": "exampleobject",
      "rule": "imageMogr2/grayscale/<value>"
  }]
}
```

## Parameters

Operation name: grayscale.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ObjectKey  | Object name, such as `folder/sample.jpg`.                           | 
| /grayscale/&lt;value> | Whether to set an image to be a grayscale image. <br>Valid values of the `value` field: `0` (no), `1` (yes). |
| /ignore-error/1 | If this parameter is carried and the image fails to be processed because the image is too large or a parameter value exceeds the limit, the input image will be returned with no error reported. |

## Samples

>? **Processing during download** is used as an example here, which does not store the output image in a bucket. If you need to store the output image, see [Persistent Image Processing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33695) and use the **processing during upload** or **processing in-cloud data** feature.

#### Sample 1: Setting an image to be a grayscale image

This example sets an image to be a grayscale image:

```plaintext
http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?imageMogr2/grayscale/1
```

Output image:

![img](http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?imageMogr2/grayscale/1)

#### Sample 2: Sharpening an image with a signature carried

This example processes the image in the same way as in the example above, except that a signature is carried. The signature is concatenated with other processing parameters by an ampersand (&).

```plaintext
http://examples-1251000004.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.jpeg?q-sign-algorithm=<signature>&imageMogr2/grayscale/1
```

>? You can get the value of `<signature>` as instructed in [Request Signature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7778).
>

## Notes

To prevent unauthorized users from accessing or downloading the input image by using a URL that does not contain any processing parameter, you can add the processing parameters to the request signature, making the processing parameters the key of the parameter with the value left empty. The following is a simple sample for your reference (it might have expired or become inaccessible).
