## Overview

The file preview feature allows generating images from multiple types of files for preview and performing basic processing operations on the output images synchronously. It addresses the display problems of file content on webpages and enables easy online file preview on PC, app, and other terminals. It is widely suitable for diverse business scenarios, such as online education, enterprise OA, and website transcoding.

> ?
> - To use this feature, you need to click **File Processing** on the management page of a bucket in the [CI console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ci), find the **File Preview** configuration item, and toggle it on. Then, you can call a specific file preview API to preview files in the bucket synchronously or asynchronously.
> - File preview is a paid feature. For billing details, see [File Processing Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49490).
> - The conversion logic of file transcoding is the same as that of local printing. If you need to change the conversion orientation (such as outputting an Excel file with many columns horizontally to one page), you need to change the source file print settings.

| dstType | Type of the output target file. Valid values: <br><li>png <br><li>jpg <br><li>pdf (the page number cannot be selected, and the `page` parameter does not take effect) <br/>If the input file format cannot be recognized, the `jpg` format will be used by default. | String | No |
| password | Password to open the Office file. If you need to convert a password-protected file, set this field. | String | No |
| comment    | Whether to hide comments and apply track changes. 0: hide comments and apply track changes; 1: show comments and track changes. Default value: 0. | Int    | No       |
