## Overview
Part-of-speech analysis is a text analysis and mining capability provided for various enterprises and developers. It can help users efficiently process text and realize word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.


## Use Cases

### Text analysis
The part-of-speech tagging service can attach a corresponding part of speech to each word after word segmentation and then quickly carry out deeper text mining processing, and subsequent material classification, archiving, statistics, and other operations, without worrying about new word discovery, ambiguity elimination, or other issues.

### Statistics of high-frequency words
It can be used with speech recognition to perform part-of-speech analysis on the text results of speech recognition, and count high-frequency entity words for recommendations.



## How to Use

You can process words stored in COS by using the CI's word segmentation job API. For details, see [Submitting Word Segmentation Job](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49790) in the API documentation.
