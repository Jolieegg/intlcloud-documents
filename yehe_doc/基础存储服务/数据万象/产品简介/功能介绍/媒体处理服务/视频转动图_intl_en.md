## Overview

CI's video to animated image conversion feature converts a video file into an animated image file. You can specify the video segment for conversion, frame sampling method, as well as the frame rate, size, and format of the output animated image to meet your different needs.


## Use Cases

#### Quick video preview

The video to animated image conversion feature allows you to select the highlights in a video on your video platform to convert them into an animated image for video preview, so that users can get a glimpse of the video without playing it back. Compared with traditional static video thumbnails, animated image thumbnails increase the click rate and video playbacks.

#### Sticker production

As a major category of content shared on social media platforms, stickers are more suitable for large-scale and fast dissemination than videos. The video to animated image conversion feature can quickly generate a large number of stickers in batches, improving the distribution efficiency and facilitating content dissemination.


## How to Use

You can use the video to animated image conversion feature through jobs or workflows. In order to improve the operational efficiency and reduce repetitive operations, CI offers the template feature, which is a configuration item in jobs and workflows. You can save common parameter combinations as templates and reuse them directly in subsequent operations, with no need to set the parameters every time you start a job. You can use a preset or custom template as follows:
- Preset template: Currently, CI provides a variety of preset templates for most video to animated image conversion use cases. You can view all such templates in the [CI console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ci).
- Custom templates: You can create templates in the console. You can also [create](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product//1045/43631), [modify](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product//1045/43634), [find](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product//1045/43633), and [delete](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product//1045/43632) templates through APIs.
