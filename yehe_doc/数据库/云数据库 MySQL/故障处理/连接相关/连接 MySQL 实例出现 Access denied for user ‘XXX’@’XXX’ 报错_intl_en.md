## Troubleshooting
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and click the ID of the target instance in the instance list to enter the instance management page.
2. On the instance management page, select **Database Management** > **Account Management** and check whether the account name and host name match.
>?If the account name and host name do not match, you can proceed as follows:
>- Option 1: Check whether the host has another account name, and if so, use that account name and the corresponding password for login.
>- Option 2: Add the IP address of the current host under the current account name. To clone the account, click **Clone Account** in the **Operation** column of the account, change the **Host** parameter value to the IP address of the host you need to log in to in the **Clone Account** pop-up window, and click **OK**.
