To provide you with more comprehensive and convenient instance monitoring services, TencentDB for MySQL now supports advanced metrics for alarms, performance analysis, and failure alarming. If needed, you can go to the [integration center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/integration) to select the metric set.
- The basic metric set only covers MySQL basic metrics, including visualization, alarms, and API calls. You can use them for free.
- The advanced metric set covers both basic and advanced metrics, including visualization, alarms, and API calls. After enabling advanced metric set, you can continue to use the basic metrics for free and only pay for the data points generated by the advanced metrics.

>?
>- You can use the advanced metric set for free before July 1, 2022, after which you will be charged based on the actual number of data points generated by the advanced metrics at the minimum granularity.
>- To enable or disable the advanced metrics, go to the [integration center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/integration) to do so in the TCOP console.
