## Impact of Change
There will be one or two breakpoints in certain monitoring metrics, but they will have no effect on the operation of your database instances. Key metrics such as CPU, memory utilization, and read/write rate will not be affected, nor will alarm events such as HA switch and running failures.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
