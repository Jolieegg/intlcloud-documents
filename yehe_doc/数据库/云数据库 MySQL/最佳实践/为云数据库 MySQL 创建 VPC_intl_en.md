Tencent Cloud provides [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535), a platform for hosting TencentDB instances. You can launch Tencent Cloud resources in a VPC, such as TencentDB instances.

A common scheme is to share data between a TencentDB instance and a web server running in the same VPC. This document uses this scheme to create a VPC and add a TencentDB instance to it.
Below describes how to add CVM and TencentDB for MySQL instances in the same VPC to interconnect cloud resources over the private network.

## Step 1. Create a VPC
A VPC has at least one subnet, and Tencent Cloud service resources can only be added in a subnet.
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Select the region of the VPC at the top of the list and click **Create**.
3. Enter the VPC information and the initial subnet information, and click **OK**. The CIDRs of the VPC and subnet cannot be modified after creation.
 - The VPC CIDR can be any of the following IP ranges. If you want two VPCs to communicate with each other over the private network, their CIDRs should not overlap.
    - `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (mask range between 11 and 28)
    - `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (mask range between 11 and 28)
    - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (mask range between 16 and 28)
 - The subnet CIDR must be within or the same as the VPC CIDR.
 For example, if the IP range of a VPC is `192.168.0.0/16`, then that of its subnets can be `192.168.0.0/16`, `192.168.0.0/17`, etc.

## Step 2. Create a subnet
You can create one or more subnets at a time.
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
3. Select the region and VPC in which the subnet is to be created and click **Create**.
4. Enter the subnetâ€™s name, CIDR, AZ, and associated route table.

5. (Optional) Click **+New line** to create multiple subnets at a time.
6. Click **Create**.

## Step 3. Create a route table and associate it with a subnet
You can create a custom route table, edit its routing policy, and associate it with a specified subnet. The route table associated with a subnet is used to specify the outbound routes for the subnet.
1. Log in to the VPC Console and select **Route Tables** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the region and VPC at the top of the list and click **Create**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the name, network, routing rules and click **Create**. Return to the route table list to view the newly created route table.

4. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar, select the subnet to be associated with the route table, and click **More** > **Change route table** in the **Operation** column to associate it.

## Step 4. Add a CVM instance
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
3. Select the target subnet, click the icon in the **CVM** column to add a CVM.

4. Complete the purchase of the CVM instance as instructed on the page. For more information, see [Purchasing Channels](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/506).

## Step 5. Add a TencentDB instance
#### New database
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and click **Create** in the instance list to enter the purchase page.
2. In the **Network** section on the purchase page, select the previously created VPC and the corresponding subnet, and add the new TencentDB instance to the VPC.

#### Existing database
1. In the [instance list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb), click an instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
2. In the **Network** section on the details page, switch to the corresponding VPC.
