This document describes how to view the TencenDB for MySQL instance backup space and free tier in the console.

## Overview
- For two-node and three-node instances of local disk edition, the backup space occupied by TencentDB for MySQL instance backup files is allocated by region. It is equivalent to the total storage capacity used by all database backups in a region, including automatic data backups, manual data backups, and log backups. Increasing the backup retention period or manual backup frequency will use more database backup space.

- For single-node instances of cloud disk edition, the backup space occupied by TencentDB for MySQL instance backup files is allocated by instance. The free backup space of one instance is equivalent to 200% of its storage space.

## Viewing the backup space and free tier of an instance of local disk edition
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and select **Database Backup** on the left sidebar.
2. Select a region at the top to view its backup information on the **Overview** tab, including total backup, backup trend, and real-time backup statistics.
 - Total Backup: This section displays the size and quantity of all backups, data backups, and log backups as well as the free tier occupied by all the backups.
