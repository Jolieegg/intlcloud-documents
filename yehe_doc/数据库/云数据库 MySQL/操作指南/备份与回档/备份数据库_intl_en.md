To avoid data loss or corruption, you can back up a database automatically or manually.

## Backup Overview
### Backup modes
TencentDB for MySQL single-node (cloud disk), two-node (local disk), and three-node (local disk) instances support **automatic backup** and **manual backup** of databases.

### Backup types
**TencentDB for MySQL two-node and three-node instances support two backup types:**
- **Physical backup**, which is a full copy of physical data (supported for both automatic backup and manual backup).
- **Logical backup**, which backs up SQL statements (only supported for manual backup).
>?
>- To restore a database from a physical backup, you need to use xbstream to decompress the package first. For more information, see [Restoring Database from Physical Backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31910).
>- If the number of tables in a single instance exceeds one million, backup may fail and database monitoring may be affected. Make sure that the number of tables in a single instance is below one million.
>- As the data of tables created by the MEMORY storage engine is stored in the memory, physical backups cannot be created for such tables. To avoid data loss, we recommend that you replace them with InnoDB tables.
>- If there are a high number of tables without a primary key in the instance, backup may fail, and the high availability of the instance may be affected. You need to create a primary key or secondary index for such tables in time.

| Physical Backup Advantages | Logical Backup Disadvantages |
|---------|---------|
| <li>High backup speed. <li>Streaming backup and compression are supported. <li>High success rate. <li>Simple and efficient restoration. <li>Faster backup-based coupling operations such as adding real-only instances and disaster recovery instances. <li>1/8 of average time needed for creating a logical backup. <li>Ten times faster than logical backups during import. | <li>Long time needed to restore as it takes time to run SQL statements and build indexes. <li>Low backup speed, especially when there are massive amounts of data. <li>Possible increase in source-replica delay due to the pressure on instances during backup. <li>Possible loss of precision information of floating points. <li>Potential backup failures due to wrong views and other problems. <li>Slower backup-based coupling operations such as adding read-only instances and disaster recovery instances. </li> |

**TencentDB for MySQL single-node instances of cloud disk edition support **snapshot backup**:**
**Snapshot backup** backs up data by creating snapshots for disks at the storage layer and is supported for both automatic and manual backups.

| Snapshot Backup Advantages | Snapshot Backup Disadvantages |
|---------|---------|
| <li>High backup speed. <li>Small size. | Cannot be downloaded. |


### Backup objects
 | Data Backup | Log Backup |
|---------|---------|
 | TencentDB for MySQL two-node and three-node instances: <li>Automatic backup supports full physical backup. <li>Manual backup supports full physical backup, full logical backup, and single-database/table logical backup. <li>Both automatic and manual backups can be compressed and downloaded. <br>Single-node instances of cloud disk edition:<li>Automatic backup supports full snapshot backup. <li>Manual backup supports full snapshot backup. <li>Both automatic and manual backups cannot be downloaded. | TencentDB for MySQL single-node (cloud disk edition), two-node, and three-node instances support binlog backup:<li>Log files occupy the instance's backup space. <li>Log files can be downloaded but cannot be compressed. <li>Retention periods can be set for log files. </li> |

## Note
- Since February 26, 2019, the automatic backup feature of TencentDB for MySQL only supports physical backup (default type) and no longer provides logical backup. automatically. Existing automatic logical backups will be switched to physical backups 
This will not affect your business access, but may have impact on your habit of automatic backup. If you need logical backups, you can use the manual backup option in the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) or call the [CreateBackup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/15844) API to generate logical backups.
- Instance backup files occupy backup space. We recommend that you plan the usage of backup space appropriately. Usage of backup space that exceeds the free tier will incur fees. For more information, see [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/32344).
- We recommend that you back up your database during off-peak hours.
- To avoid situations where the required backup files are deleted after the retention period lapses, you need to download them to the local file system in a timely manner.
- Do not perform DDL operations during the backup process to avoid backup failure due to table locking.
- TencentDB for MySQL single-node instances cannot be backed up.

## [Backing up MySQL Data Automatically](id:ZDBFSJ)
### Configuring automatic backup
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb), click an instance ID on the instance list page to enter the management page, and select **Backup and Restoration** > **Auto-Backup Settings**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/da6aad42478cbbddba52d02b1d677238.png)
2. Select backup parameters in the pop-up window as detailed below and click **OK**:
>?
> - The rollback feature as described in [Rolling back Databases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/7276) relies on the backup cycle and retention days of data backups and log backups (binlog). Rollback will be affected if you reduce the automatic backup frequency and retention period. You can select the parameters as needed.
> For example, if the backup cycle is set as Monday and Thursday and the retention period is set as seven days, you can roll a database back to any point of time in the past seven days, which is the actual retention days of data backups and log backups.
> - Automatic backups cannot be deleted manually. You can set the retention period for automatic backups, and the backups will be deleted automatically when they expire.
> - Increasing the retention period of data and log backups may cause additional backup space fees.
> - Shortening the retention period of log backups may affect the data rollback cycle of the instance.

In **Auto-Backup Settings**, you can enable periodic archive for data backups. The settings with periodic archive not enabled are non-archive backup settings. The following describes the parameters for **non-archive backup** and **archive backup**.

Expired backup sets will be automatically deleted and cannot be downloaded or restored.
- We recommend that you configure a reasonable backup retention period based on your business needs or download the backup files in the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). Note that the backup files of single-node instances of cloud disk edition cannot be downloaded.
- You can also manually back up instance data in the console. Manual backups will be retained permanently.
>?Manual backups will also take up the backup space. We recommend that you plan the usage of the backup space appropriately to reduce costs.

#### 2. Can I delete backups manually?
- You can't delete automatic backups manually, but you can set the retention period for them so that they are deleted automatically upon expiration. 
- For two-node and three-node instances, manual backups can be manually deleted from the backup list in the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). Manual backups are retained permanently as long as they are not deleted. For single-node instances of cloud disk edition, manual backups cannot be deleted.

#### 3. Can I disable data and log backups?
No. However, you can reduce the backup frequency and delete unnecessary manual backups in the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) to lower the space usage. Note that the manual backups of single-node instances of cloud disk edition cannot be deleted.

#### 4. How do I reduce the backup space costs?
- Delete manual backups that are no longer used. You can log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb), click an instance ID/name to access the instance management page, and delete manual backups on the **Backup and Restore** tab. Note that the manual backups of single-node instances of cloud disk edition cannot be deleted. 
- Reduce the frequency of automatic data backup for non-core businesses. You can adjust the backup cycle and retention period in the console, and the frequency should be at least twice a week.
>?The rollback feature relies on the backup cycle and retention days of data backups and log backups (binlog). Rollback will be affected if you reduce the automatic backup frequency and retention period. You can select the parameters as needed. For more information, see [Rolling back Databases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/7276).
