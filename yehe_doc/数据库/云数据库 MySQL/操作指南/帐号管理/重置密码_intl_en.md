## Overview
If you forgot your database account password or need to change it while using TencentDB for MySQL, you can reset it in the console.

>- For TencentDB for MySQL, the password resetting feature has been connected to [CAM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/14469); therefore, we recommend that you exercise tighter control over the permission to this API (password resetting) or sensitive resources (i.e., TencentDB for MySQL instances) by granting such permission only to appropriate personnel.
>- For data security, we recommend that you regularly reset the password at least once every three months.


## Directions

2. On the instance management page, select **Database Management** > **Account Management**, find the account for which to reset the password, and click **Reset Password** or select **More** > **Reset Password**.
