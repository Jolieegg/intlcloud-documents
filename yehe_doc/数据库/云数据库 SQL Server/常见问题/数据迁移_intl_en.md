### How do I migrate data to TencentDB for SQL Server?
You can migrate data from self-built SQL Server databases in local IDCs, CVM instances, and cloud servers provided by other cloud vendors, cloud SQL Server databases provided by other cloud vendors, and TencentDB for SQL Server databases to TencentDB for SQL Server through either [cold backup migration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/238/39005) or [DTS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/238/39006) as appropriated based on your business scenarios.
- If your business allows you to shut down the database for backup, you can use [cold backup migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/39005), i.e., restoring data from .bak backup files to migrate the source database to a TencentDB for SQL Server instance. You can download COS files or upload local files for migration. Three data restoration modes are supported: full backups, full backups + log backups, and full backups + differential backups.
- If your business doesn't allow you to shut down the database and requires smooth migration, you can do so as instructed in [Migration with DTS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/238/39006). DTS supports two migration modes: full migration and full + incremental migration. It supports multiple access types, such as public network, self-build on CVM, Direct Connect, VPN, CCN, and database.

### What should I check before using DTS for data migration to the cloud?
We recommend that you check the following items in the source and target databases before using DTS for data migration to the cloud:
- Version numbers of source and target databases. The target database must be on a version later than or equal to the source database. For example, if the source database is on v2016, the target database can only be on v2016, v2017, or v2019.
- Architecture versions of source and target databases. If the source instance is a self-built database in a local IDC, CVM instance, or cloud server in another cloud vendor, or is a cloud SQL Server instance in another cloud vendor, you can migrate it to a TencentDB for SQL Server single-node (formerly basic edition) instance or two-node (formerly high-availability/cluster edition) instance on any architecture version. If the source instance is a TencentDB for SQL Server two-node (formerly high-availability/cluster edition) instance, it cannot be migrated to a single-node (formerly basic edition) instance through DTS. If the source instance is a TencentDB for SQL Server single-node (formerly basic edition) instance, it can be migrated to a two-node (formerly high-availability/cluster edition) instance through DTS.
- Network connectivity between source and target databases. The source and target databases must be connected. The server where the source database resides must have enough outbound bandwidth; otherwise, the migration efficiency will be affected.
- Names of source and target databases. The source and target instances cannot have databases with the same name.
- Account permissions of the source database. You need to change to "local" for SQL service startup in the source database. The source database account is unrestricted but needs to have the sysadmin permissions.
- Account permissions of the target database. The target database needs to have an account with admin permissions for migration.
- Ports of the source database. The source database needs to open port 1433, and the service where the source database is located must open the file sharing port 445 for Windows server sharing.
- Recovery model of the source database. The source database must be set to "full recovery model", and we recommend that you make a full backup before migration.
- Local disk space of the source database. The local disk space of the source database must be large enough, so that the remaining free space can fit the size of the database to be migrated.
- Disk space of the target database. The disk space of the target database must be at least 1.5 times the size of the source database.
- Status of the target database. The target database cannot have access requests or active businesses; otherwise, the migration will fail.

### What should I check when using DTS for data migration to the cloud?
You need to keep the following operation limits in mind when using DTS for migration:
- Only one migration task can be initiated at any time for the same source instance.
- Only database-level migration is supported (i.e., all objects in the database must be migrated together), while single-table migration is not supported.
- Logins, jobs, triggers, and database links (link server) at the instance level cannot be migrated.
- Do not modify or delete user information (including username, password, and permissions) in the source and target databases and port numbers during migration; otherwise, the migration task will fail.
- Do not perform transaction log backup during incremental sync; otherwise, the transaction log will be truncated and become discontinuous.
- If you only perform full data migration, do not write new data into the source database during migration; otherwise, the data in the source and target databases will be inconsistent. In scenarios with data writes, to ensure the data consistency in real time, we recommend that you select full + incremental data migration.
- For full + incremental data migration, after you click **Complete** and the task status becomes **Completed**, do not write new data to the source database. We recommend that you stop writing for two minutes; otherwise, the data in the source and target databases may be inconsistent.

### What should I check after using DTS for data migration to the cloud?
We recommend that you check the following items in the target database after using DTS for migration:
- Permission completeness. Permissions will affect operations performed on the database. The migration only restores data. To restore other service-level permissions, such as database users and login usernames, you need to create them again and associate them with database accounts.
- Reindexing. As the physical environment of the data files changes, database indexes will become invalid, and you need to create indexes again; otherwise, the database performance may be significantly compromised.
- Instance-level objects such as logins, jobs, triggers, and database links (link server). You need to create them again after the migration is completed.
