This document describes how to adjust the instance version in the TencentDB for SQL Server console.

## Supported versions
TencentDB for SQL Server single-node (formerly basic edition) and two-node (formerly high-availability/cluster edition) instances support version upgrade.

## Prerequisites
You can adjust the configuration of a TencentDB for SQL Server instance and its associated instances only when they are in running status and are not executing any tasks.

## Note
Currently, the database version cannot be downgraded back after an upgrade.

## Impact of configuration adjustment
- Data migration will be involved during the instance configuration adjustment, and the larger the data volume, the longer the data migration time. Access to the instance will not be affected during this period.
- A switch will be performed after migration is completed, which causes a momentary disconnection from the database for a few seconds. Make sure that your business has a reconnection mechanism.
- Most database, account, and network operations are unavailable during the momentary disconnection. Therefore, we recommend that you perform the switch during off-peak hours.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver), select the region and target instance in the instance list, and click **Adjust Configuration** in the **Operation** column.

3. For pay-as-you-go instances, click **Adjust** in the window.
4. You will be redirected to the instance list. When the instance status changes from **Adjusting instance configuration** to **Running**, the version upgrade is completed. You can query and check the new version on the **Instance List** or **Instance Details** page.
