Scheduled purge/prefetch tasks can be triggered through SCF. Such tasks are included in the daily purge/prefetch quota and may fail to be executed if the quota is exceeded.

## Configuration Guide

Log in to the [CDN console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), select **Plugin Center** on the sidebar, click the scheduled purge/prefetch plugin feature block, and enable scheduled purge/prefetch to enter the task configuration page. After this feature is enabled, you can also click **Basic Configuration** at the bottom of the block to enter the scheduled purge/prefetch task list page for configuration.

On the **Create Scheduled Task** page, select the desired task type, set the cron scheduling expression (see the example), enter the corresponding purge/prefetch URLs, and perform SCF authorization. Then, the system can automatically generate the corresponding SCF function and trigger the task as scheduled.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left" style="width:120px">Wildcard</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">, (comma)</td>
<td align="left">It represents the union of characters separated by comma; for example, 1, 2, 3 in the "Hour" field means 1:00, 2:00 and 3:00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">- (hyphen)</td>
<td align="left">It contains all values in the specified range; for example, in the "Day" field, 1-15 contains the 1st to the 15th day of the specified month</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">* (asterisk)</td>
<td align="left">It means all values; for example, in the "Hour" field, * means every o'clock</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">/ (forward slash)</td>
<td align="left">It specifies the increment; for example, in the "Minute" field, you can enter 1/10 to specify repeating every ten minutes from the first minute on (e.g., at the 11th minute, the 21st minute, the 31st minute, and so on)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


>!When both the "Day" and "Week" fields in a cron expression are specified, they are in an "or" relationship, i.e., the conditions of both are effective separately.

## Billing

The scheduled purge/prefetch feature is free of charge. However, it will call SCF to create scheduled tasks, which will incur SCF fees. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/17299).
