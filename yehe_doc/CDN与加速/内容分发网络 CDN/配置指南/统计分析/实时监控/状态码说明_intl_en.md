The table below explains the [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) of the webpage server.

| Status code | Meaning |
|-|-|
| 100 | The server received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). The client should ignore the response if the request is already complete. The server must send a final response to the client after the request is complete. To have the server check the request headers, the client must send `Expect: 100-continue` as a header in its initial request and receive a `100 Continue` status code in the response before sending the body. The status code 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the client should not continue with the request. |
| 101 | The server understood the request of the client and will notify the client by using the `Upgrade` header to use a different protocol to finish the request. After sending the last blank line of this response, the server will switch to the protocol that is defined in the `Upgrade` header. The server should switch protocols only if it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP, such as HTTP/2, has advantages over older versions, or switching to a real-time and synchronous protocol, such as WebSocket, helps transfer resources that use related features. |
| 102 | A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests that involve file operations, requiring a long time to complete the request. This status code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming that the request was lost. |
| 103 | This status code is used to return some response headers before the final HTTP message. |
| 200 | The request has succeeded, and the response headers or body expected by the request will be returned with this response. If the client made a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. If the client made a POST request, the response will contain an entity that describes or contains the result of the action. |
| 201 | The request has been fulfilled by the server, resulting in the creation of a new resource. The URI of the resource has been returned with the `Location` header. If the required resource cannot be created in a timely manner, the `202 Accepted` status code should be returned. |
| 202 | The server has accepted the request but has not processed it. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs. |
| 203 | The server is a transforming proxy (such as a web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the response of the origin. |
| 204 | The server successfully processed the request of the client and is not returning any content. In the captive portal feature, when a Wi-Fi device is connected to a Wi-Fi access point that requires web authentication, if the device accesses a website that can generate an HTTP 204 response and receives an HTTP 204 response normally, web authentication is not required. Otherwise, the authentication interface will pop up on the web browser for the user to complete authentication and login. |
| 205 | The server successfully processed the request of the client and is not returning any content. Unlike the 204 response, this response requires the client to reset the document view. |
| 206 | The server successfully processed part of the GET request. HTTP download tools, such as FlashGet or Thunder, use this type of response to implement checkpoint restart or split a large file into multiple fragments for simultaneous download. |
| 207 | The message body that follows is an XML message and may contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made. |
| 208 | The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a preceding part of the multi-status response, and will not be included again. |
| 226 | The server has fulfilled the request of the client for a given resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance manipulations applied to the current instance. |
| 300 | Multiple options are available for the requested resource, each with its own specific address and browser-driven negotiation information. The user or browser can choose a preferred address to redirect itself. |
| 301 | This status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to the new URI contained in the response. A browser automatically redirects to the new URL. All future requests should be directed to the new URI. |
| 302 | This status code is similar to the status code 301, but it indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved and the client should still use the original URI. |
| 303 | The response to the request can be found under another URI. When the response is received in response to a POST, PUT, or DELETE request, the client should assume that the server has received the data and should issue a new GET request to the given URI. |
| 304 | The requested resource has not been modified since the version that is specified by the If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match request header. In the case where this status code is returned, the resource does not need to be retransmitted because the client still has a previously downloaded copy. |
| 305 | The requested resource can be accessed only through the specified proxy. The Location field contains the URI information of the specified proxy. The receiver needs to issue a new request to access the requested resource through the proxy. |
| 306 | This status code is no longer used in the latest version of HTTP specifications. It originally meant that subsequent requests should use the specified proxy. |
| 307 | This status code indicates that the request should be repeated by using another URI and that future requests should still use the original URI. This is different from how the status code 302 was historically implemented, in that the request method cannot be changed when the original request is reissued. For example, a POST request should be repeated by using another POST request. |
| 308 | The request and all future requests should be repeated by using another URI. Status codes 307 and 308 are similar to the behaviors of status codes 302 and 301, but 307 and 308 do not allow the HTTP method to be changed. For example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly. |
| 401 | This status code is similar to the status code 403 except that it is specifically used when required authentication has failed or has not yet been provided by the client. |
| 405 | The request method specified in the request-line cannot be used to request the resource. The server must generate an Allow header field in a 405 status code response. The field must contain a list of methods that the resource currently supports. |
| 406 | The content property of the requested resource does not meet the conditions in the request headers. Therefore, no response entity can be generated. The request is not acceptable. |
| 407 | This status code is similar to the status code 401, but it indicates that the client must authenticate itself with the proxy. |
| 408 | The server timed out while waiting for the request from the client. According to HTTP specifications: "The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time." |
| 409 | This status code indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the current state of the resource, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates. |
| 410 | This status code indicates that the resource requested was previously in use but is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a status code 410, the client should not request the resource in the future. Most servers use the status code 404 instead of this status code. |
| 411 | The server refuses to accept the request without a defined `Content-Length` header. The client can re-submit the request after adding a valid `Content-Length` header that describes the length of the message body to the request. |
| 412 | One or more preconditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when verified on the server. This status code allows the client to place preconditions on the request metadata in the request header fields when it requests for a resource. This prevents the request method from being applied to resources that are not requested by the client. |
| 415 | The Internet media type submitted in the request for the resource by using the current request method is not supported by the server. As a result, the server refuses the request. For example, the client uploads an image in the SVG format, but the server requires images to be uploaded in the JPG format. |
| 416 | The client asked for a portion of the file, but the server cannot supply that portion. For example, this status code is returned if the client asked for a portion of the file that lies beyond the end of the file. |
| 417 | The server cannot meet the expectation given in the Expect header of the request. |
| 500 | This is a generic error message returned to the client when the server encounters an unexpected condition that prevents it from fulfilling the request. No specific error information is provided. |
| 501 | The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource. |
| 505 | The server does not support or refuses to support the HTTP version used in the request. The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request by using the same version as the client. The response should contain an entity that describes the reason why that version is not supported and the other protocols that are supported by the server. |
| 508 | The server encountered an infinite loop while processing the request. |
| 510 | The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request. |
