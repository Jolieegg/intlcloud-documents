## Feature Overview
CDN can monitor the latency and availability status of ISP in each province in Mainland China and each region outside Mainland China. It continues to send requests to monitoring files at selected nodes around the world and collects the response data of these requests. You can view real-time status and details of the entire network in the CDN Console.
>The entire network monitoring feature monitors the service status of the CDN platform, not the actual service status of your business.
