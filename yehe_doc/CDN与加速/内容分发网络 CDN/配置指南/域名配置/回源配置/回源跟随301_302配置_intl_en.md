## Configuration
Tencent Cloud CDN does not cache 301/302 status codes by default. When an origin server returns a 301/302 request, the CDN node will return the response to the client by default, and the client will be redirected to the corresponding resource for access.

When the follow 301/302 redirect configuration is enabled, the CDN node will be redirected when receiving a 301/302 redirect request during origin-pull until it gets the required resource (up to 3 follows are supported). It will then return the actual resource to the client, which does not need to be redirected.
## Configuration Guide
### Viewing the configuration
Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), select **Domain Management** on the left sidebar, and click **Manage** to the right of the domain name to access its configuration page. Under the **Origin Configuration** tab, find **Follow 301/302 Configuration**, which is disabled by default:

### Modifying the configuration
You can toggle the follow 301/302 redirect configuration switch to enable or disable this feature:

>If your acceleration domain name is configured for global acceleration, the follow 301/302 redirect configuration will take effect globally. It does not distinguish between requests from and outside of mainland China.

## Configuration Sample
Suppose the follow 301/302 redirect configuration for the domain name `cloud.tencent.com` is as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/cbbd0f472a50287fd425cd093a2dacb9.png)
User A requests a resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`. If the cache is not hit on the node, the node will request the resource from the origin server. If the HTTP response status code returned by the origin server is 302 and the redirect address is `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, then:

1. After follow 301/302 redirect is enabled, the node will directly initiate a request to the redirect address when it receives the HTTP response with the 301/302 status code.
2. The resource will be obtained, cached to the node, and returned to the user.
3. At this time, if user B also sends a request for `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, the cache will be hit on the node and the resource will be returned to the user.
4. After follow 301/302 redirect is enabled, up to 3 follows are allowed. If this limit is exceeded, the 301/302 status code will be returned to the user.

Suppose the follow 301/302 redirect configuration for the domain name `cloud.tencent.com` is as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3d431956857ef20b21bb954e481c66e4.png)
User A requests a resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`. If the cache is not hit on the node, the node will request the resource from the origin server. If the HTTP response status code returned by the origin server is 301/302 and the redirect address is `http://xxx.tencent.com/1.jpg`, then:
1. The node will directly return the HTTP response to the user.
2. When the user initiates a request for `http://xxx.tencent.com/1.jpg`, no acceleration will take effect if the domain name is not connected to CDN.
3. At this time, if user B also sends a request for `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, the process above will be repeated.
