## Configuration Overview
HTTP2.0 is the latest HTTP version which greatly enhances the web performance and further reduces the network delay. HTTP2.0 can be directly enabled for the domain names with certificates configured and HTTPS acceleration enabled.
> !Currently, only HTTP2.0 access is supported. HTTP2.0 origin-pull is not supported.


## Configuration Guide
