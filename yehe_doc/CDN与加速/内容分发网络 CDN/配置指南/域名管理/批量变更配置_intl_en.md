>!
>- Configurations of disabled, blocked, and locked domain names cannot be changed in batches.
>- For domain name configurations that are not completed on the console, configuration changes do not apply.


## Notes

- Configuration changes take effect immediately and cannot be reversed.
- Choose domain names with the same configurations on acceleration region, service type, or HTTPS certificate 
- To batch change the HTTPS certificate configurations, please go to the certificate management page.
- Up to 20 domain names can be changed at a time. Itâ€™s not suggested to choose too many domain names as it may take quite a long time for the change to take effect.
