When you have specified both `Action` and `Resource` to create a custom policy, you can call APIs to perform operations for desired resources. This document describes the mappings between console features and `Action`.

>!
> - Tencent Cloud CDN can authorize resources by domain name. Authorization does not distinguish between service regions in and outside the Chinese mainland under the same domain name.
> - When you migrate ECDN services to the CDN console, the ECDN API permission policies will be automatically mapped to corresponding CDN API permission policies. However for resource-level permission policies, you need to set them again in CDN after the migration.
