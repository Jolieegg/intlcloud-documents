Welcome to Tencent Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN).

CDN distributes your business content to the edge servers closest to visitors, so that visitors can retrieve content from the nearest nodes. This can reduce access latency caused by cross-region content fetching, bandwidth limits, or server capability limits, thereby improving user experience.
