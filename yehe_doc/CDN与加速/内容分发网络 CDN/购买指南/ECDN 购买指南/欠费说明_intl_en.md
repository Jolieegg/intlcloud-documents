## Arrears Status
ECDN is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The system will generate a bill and deduct the fees based on your actual usage in the last billing cycle. If your account balance is insufficient, your account will become negative and fall into arrears.
**Note:**
If your account falls into arrears when you purchase or use another Tencent Cloud service, your use of ECDN will be affected.

## Arrears Alarming
If your account balance becomes negative, your account will fall into arrears, and the system will push an **arrears notification**, which will be triggered only once when your account balance turns negative.

## Grace Period
To avoid affecting your business, the system grants your account in arrears a grace period for arrears handling, during which it will push arrears notifications to remind you to top up promptly.

- During the grace period, the current ECDN service of your account will **not be affected** and can still be used.
- During the grace period, you can change the current ECDN acceleration service configuration of your account.
- If you are billed monthly, the grace period will be 24 hours by default.
- If you are billed hourly, the grace period will be 2 hours by default.

## Service Suspension Period
- If your fail to top up your account within the grace period, it will enter the service suspension period, and the system will push a **service suspension notification**. At this point, be sure to top up as soon as possible.
- During the service suspension period, restrictions will be put on your use of service, including but not limited to:
   - Your account will be locked, and you cannot add or change the ECDN acceleration service.
   - All your ECDN services will be automatically disabled. After that, acceleration domain names will be directly resolved to the origin server and no longer enjoy acceleration services.

## Account Top-up
- When your account is in arrears, you can enable ECDN again in the console after topping up. Â  
- For acceleration domain names that are forcibly deactivated due to arrears, you need to activate them again in the console before you can use ECDN again.
