> Note:
>
> 
>
> - Each CDN node collects traffic data in real time and reports it to the billing center which aggregates the data entries into total traffic data. For bill-by-bandwidth, the bandwidth values are collected in 5-minute granularity, i.e., bandwidth value = 5-minute total traffic / 300 s. For example, if the total traffic generated in 5 minutes is 30 MB, the corresponding bandwidth will be (30 * 8) / 300 = 0.8 Mbps (1 MB = 8 Mbps).
> - Base conversion: 1 GB = 1,000 MB; 1 MB = 1,000 KB; 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps; 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps.

## Billing Details

### Bill-by-peak bandwidth

CDN bandwidth adopts the **tiered pricing** as follows:

| Bandwidth Tier (USD/Mbps/day) | Chinese mainland (CN) | North America (NA) | Europe (EU) | Asia Pacific Region 1 (AP1) | Asia Pacific Region 2 (AP2) | Asia Pacific Region 3 (AP3) | Middle East (ME) | Africa (AA) | South America (SA) |
| :----------------------- | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 0 Mbps - 500 Mbps          | 0.0815         | 0.2069    | 0.2069    | 0.3647        | 0.3928        | 0.5140        | 0.7391    | 0.5612    | 0.5612    |
| 500 Mbps - 5 Gbps          | 0.0800         | 0.1964    | 0.1964    | 0.3216        | 0.3402        | 0.4679       | 0.6754   | 0.5137    | 0.5137    |
| 5 Gbps - 50 Gbps           | 0.0754         | 0.1491    | 0.1491    | 0.2703        | 0.2859        | 0.3828        | 0.6075    | 0.4702    | 0.4702    |
| ≥ 50 Gbps                 | 0.0738       | 0.1055    | 0.1055    | 0.2436        | 0.2545        | 0.3267           | 0.5301    | 0.4281       | 0.4281       |

> Note:
>
> 
>
> If your CDN peak bandwidth is equal to or more than 50 Gbps, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales) for discount information.

#### Calculation method

Assuming that the peak bandwidth of CDN in the Chinese mainland is X and there is no consumption outside the Chinese mainland, the calculation method for tiered pricing is as follows:

1. If X < 500 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.0815.
2. If 500 Mbps ≤ X < 5,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.0800.
3. If 5,000 Mbps ≤ X < 50,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.0754.
4. If X ≥ 50,000 Mbps, please contact us for off-line contracting. We have more discount options for you.

You can use the [Price Calculator](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/calculator/cdn) for a price estimation.

### Bill-by-traffic (hourly and daily)

CDN traffic pricing is based on a **monthly cumulative tier** as follows:

| Traffic Tier (USD/GB) | the Chinese mainland (CN) | North America (NA) | Europe (EU) | Asia Pacific Region 1 (AP1) | Asia Pacific Region 2 (AP2) | Asia Pacific Region 3 (AP3) | Middle East (ME) | Africa (AA) | South America (SA) |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 0 TB - 2 TB           | 0.0323         | 0.0452    | 0.0452    | 0.0665        | 0.0798        | 0.0897          | 0.1080    | 0.1039      | 0.1039      |
| 2 TB - 10 TB          | 0.0308         | 0.0378    | 0.0378    | 0.0592        | 0.0737        | 0.0780        | 0.1000    | 0.0970    | 0.0970    |
| 10 TB - 50 TB         | 0.0277         | 0.0319    | 0.0319    | 0.0533        | 0.0677        | 0.0723        | 0.0940    | 0.0907    | 0.0907    |
| 50 TB - 100 TB        | 0.0231         | 0.0261    | 0.0261    | 0.0475        | 0.0590        | 0.0654        | 0.0863    | 0.0842    | 0.0842    |
| ≥ 100 TB             | 0.0169          | 0.0200    | 0.0200    | 0.0446        | 0.0503        | 0.0577        | 0.0794    | 0.0781    | 0.0781    |

> Note:

> If your CDN traffic is equal to or more than 100 TB, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales) for discount information.

#### Calculation method

Unlike bill-by-bandwidth, bill-by-traffic is based on a monthly cumulative tier. Here is an example describing how the bill-by-daily traffic mode works:

- As shown in the figure below, assume that the traffic generated in the Chinese mainland on January 1 is 3 TB, and there is no consumption outside the Chinese mainland. The gray zone represents the actual billing tier and the green zone shows the traffic generated on January 1. As 2 TB lays in the 0 TB - 2 TB billing tier and the remaining 1 TB lays in the 2 TB - 10 TB tier, the actual fees for January 1 will be 2 * 1000 * 0.0323 + 1 * 1000 * 0.0308.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/bfdae242f6cca57421a65e46a96b0c67/image.png)
- As shown in the figure below, assume that the traffic generated in the Chinese mainland on January 2 is also 3 TB, and there is no consumption outside the Chinese mainland. As bill-by-traffic is based on monthly cumulative traffic, all the 3 TB lays in the 2 TB - 10 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 2 will be 3 * 1000 * 0.0308.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/f62d1056c1c2cab249cec62ad6e74ddc/image.png)
- As shown in the figure below, assume that the traffic generated in the Chinese mainland on January 3 is 7 TB and there is no consumption outside the Chinese mainland. Of this 7 TB, 4 TB lays in the 2 TB - 10 TB tier and the remaining 3 TB lays in the 10 TB - 50 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 3 will be 4 * 1000 * 0.0308 + 3 * 1000 * 0.0277.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/954e2d483e31afd411f9a91ebd7f66c8/image.png)

In this way, you can calculate the fee for each day in a month. When it is February 1, the consumption will be accumulated from 0 for tier calculation. You can use the [Price Calculator](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/calculator/cdn) for a price estimation.

### Bill-by-average daily peak bandwidth

1. Assume that a CDN billing officially starts on January 1 and the contracted price is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 valid days in January, we take the maximum value of the 288 statistical points for each of those 14 days as Max_1, Max_2, Max_3…and Max_14, respectively. The billable bandwidth will be Average (Max_1, Max_2, Max_3…and Max_14), so the January fee is: Average (Max_1, Max_2, Max_3…and Max_14) * P * 14 / 31.

### Bill-by-monthly 95th percentile bandwidth

1. Assume that a CDN billing officially starts on January 1 and the contracted price is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 valid days in January, then 14 * 288 statistical points will be collected and sorted in descending order. The highest 5% statistical points are discarded, so that Max95 is the highest point in the remaining statistical points, which is the billable bandwidth. The fee for January is: Max95 * P * 14 / 31.

## Choosing a Billing Mode

> Note:
>
> 
>
> If you noticed that the selected billing mode is not suitable for your business needs during use, you can change it. For more information, please see [Changing Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/32326).

**Options:**
CDN provides two billing modes: **bill-by-traffic** and **bill-by-bandwidth**. You can choose the billing mode as needed.

**Calculation example:**
Assuming that the traffic consumed between 00:00 and 23:59 yesterday was 200 GB, and there was no consumption in the regions outside the Chinese mainland. The peak bandwidth was 40 Mbps as the curve below:
![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/3ecfe86a031782ebeaf0b1f7595cc69f/image.png)

If you select bill-by-traffic mode, you will need to pay: 200 * 0.037 = 7.4 USD

If you select bill-by-bandwidth mode, you will need to pay: 40 * 0.094 = 3.76 USD 

In this specific example, bill-by-bandwidth is a more cost-effective billing model.

## Value-added Services

QUIC support is a value-added service, which is billed based on the number of QUIC requests.

### QUIC request billing

For details on QUIC request billing, see [QUIC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/228/39746).

> Note:
>
> - You are only charged when there’re QUIC requests.

| Billable item      | Unit Price (USD/10k Requests) | Billing Method   | Settlement Cycle |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :------- |
| QUIC request | 0.007             | Pay-as-you-go | Hourly settlement |

## Overdue

Tencent Cloud will notify you through multiple channels including email and SMS for overdue payments. A 24-hour grace period is provided. If you fail to top up your account within 24 hours, your CDN service will be suspended. After your account is topped up, the domain name status will be automatically restored to the one before service suspension (this process takes some time).

> Note:
>
> 
>
> When your acceleration service is suspended due to overdue payment, all your domain names will be disabled and all access requests will be forwarded to the origin server. You can query information but cannot modify configurations in the CDN console. Your CDN-related domain names and configurations will be retained for 12 months.
