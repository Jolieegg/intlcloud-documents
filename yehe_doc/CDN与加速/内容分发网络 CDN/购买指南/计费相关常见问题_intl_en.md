### Can CDN be billed by the number of requests?
No. Currently, CDN does not support billing by the number of requests.

### What will happen if my account is overdue?
For more information, please see the [Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949#.E6.AC.A0.E8.B4.B9.E8.AF.B4.E6.98.8E) section in the billing description document.

### If the origin server uses COS, will I be charged for traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to COS?
No. The traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to COS is billed by COS instead of CDN. For more information, please see [COS as Origin Server of CDN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/32977).

### When CDN is disabled (or deactivated), will it generate traffic and incur fees?
After the CDN domain name acceleration service is disabled, if the domain name is still configured with CNAME, a 404 status code will be returned for requests resolved to the node and a small amount of traffic will be consumed. The console will record this traffic data for your reference. Corresponding logs will also be generated. However, since your domain name acceleration service has been disabled, you will not be billed for this traffic consumption and log packets. We recommend you modify the origin-pull resolution first before disabling the acceleration service.

### How do I change the billing mode of CDN?

If you find the selected billing mode unsuitable for your actual business conditions (for more information on how to select the right billing mode for you, please see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949#.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E6.96.B9.E5.BC.8F.E9.80.89.E6.8B.A9)), you can change it by following the steps below:
1. Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), access the service overview page, and click **Change** in the billing mode section on the right.

2. Change the original billing mode from **Bill by Traffic** to **Bill by Bandwidth**.

3. After you change the billing mode to **Bill by Bandwidth**, the charge for total consumption generated on the current date will be billed and deducted on the next day.

### If the origin server uses CVM, will I be charged for traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to CVM?

No. CDN does not charge for this type of traffic.

### What is the conversion rate from Gbps to Mbps in CDN billing?

In CDN billing, 1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps, 1 Mbps = 1000 Kbps, and 1 Kbps = 1000 bps.

### Is only downstream traffic billable in CDN?

Yes. CDN only charges for downstream, not upstream traffic.


### How is CDN billed?

CDN offers two billing methods: bill-by-bandwidth and bill-by-traffic (default). Both methods are pay-as-you-go on a daily billing cycle. Payment for total consumption generated between 00:00:00–23:59:59 on the current date will be deducted before 18:00 next day. For more information on how to choose an appropriate billing method, please see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949).

### When are CDN fees deducted?

CDN is billed on a postpaid basis. The charge for total consumption generated on the current day is billed and deducted on the next day.

- If you switch from bill-by-bandwidth to bill-by-traffic and consumption has yet to occur for the day, you will be charged with the bill-by-traffic mode on the following day unless you switch the billing mode again.
- If consumption has already occurred, you will be charged with bill-by-bandwidth on the following day. You will be charged with bill-by-traffic on the third day when calculating the consumption on the second day, unless you switch the billing mode again.

If your monthly CDN service fees exceed or are expected to exceed USD 20,000, you may be eligible for a more flexible and cost-effective monthly billing plan. For more information, please submit a ticket to contact sales.

### What is monthly 95th percentile billing?

Bill-by-Bandwidth is a billing method based on peak bandwidth use.
Monthly 95th Percentile: there are 288 CDN bandwidth statistical points per day. Starting from the 1st day of the current month, all statistical points of valid days (when bandwidth is actually consumed) are sorted in order. The top 5% statistical points are removed, and the remaining highest value is the billable bandwidth. The fee is then calculated based on the listing price and settlement mode.

> Billing sample:
> Suppose a customer's billing officially started on January 1 and the contracted price is P USD/Mbps/month.
> Suppose there are 14 valid days in January, and the billable bandwidth for all 14 valid days has 14 * 288 statistical points. The highest 5% statistical points are removed so that Max95 is the highest point in the remaining statistical points, which is the billable bandwidth. The fee for January is: Max95 * P * 14 / 31.

### How can I check my CDN bills?

You can check your bills in the Tencent Cloud [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/overview). For more information, please see [Bill Query](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/6071).

### Is there a delay in using APIs to query data? How long is it?
There is a certain delay in using APIs to query data. Queries of real-time data such as access data and billing data have a delay of around 5–10 minutes, while queries of analytical data such as rankings will have delays of approximately half an hour. The data is calibrated on the backend at around 3 am Beijing Time.
