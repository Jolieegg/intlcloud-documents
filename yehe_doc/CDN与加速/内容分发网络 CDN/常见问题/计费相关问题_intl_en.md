### Can CDN be billed by the number of requests?
No. Currently, CDN does not support billing by the number of requests.

### What will happen if my account balance becomes negative?
For more information, please see [overdue payment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949#.E6.AC.A0.E8.B4.B9.E8.AF.B4.E6.98.8E) in the billing description document.

### If the origin server uses COS, will I be charged for traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to COS?
No. The traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to COS is billed by COS instead of CDN. For more information, please see [COS as Origin Server](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/32977).

### When CDN is disabled (or deactivated), will it generate traffic and incur fees?
After the CDN domain name acceleration service is disabled, if the domain name is still configured with CNAME, a 404 status code will be returned for requests resolved to the node and a small amount of traffic will be consumed. The console will record this traffic data for your reference. Corresponding logs will also be generated. However, since your domain name has been disabled, you will not be billed for this traffic consumption and log packets. We recommend you modify the origin-pull resolution first before disabling the acceleration service.

### How do I change the billing mode of CDN?

If you find the selected billing mode unsuitable for your actual business conditions (for more information on how to select the right billing mode for you, please see [Choosing a Billing Plan](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949#.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E6.96.B9.E5.BC.8F.E9.80.89.E6.8B.A9)), you can change it by following the steps below:
1. Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), access the service overview page, and click **Change** in the billing mode section on the right.

### If the origin server uses CVM, will I be charged for traffic generated by origin-pull from CDN to CVM?

No. CDN does not charge for this type of traffic.

### What is the conversion rate from Gbps to Mbps in CDN billing?

In CDN billing, 1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps, 1 Mbps = 1000 Kbps, and 1 Kbps = 1000 bps.

### Is only downstream traffic billable in CDN?

Yes. CDN only charges for downstream, not upstream traffic.


### Is there a delay in using APIs to query data? How long is it?
There is a certain delay in using APIs to query data. Queries of real-time data such as access data and billing data have a delay of around 5â€“10 minutes, while queries of analytical data such as rankings will have delays of approximately half an hour. The data is calibrated on the backend at around 3 am Beijing Time.
