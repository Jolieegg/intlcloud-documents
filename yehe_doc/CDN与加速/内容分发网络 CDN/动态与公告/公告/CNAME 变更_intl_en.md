## Background

Tencent Cloud CDN plans to update CNAME on January 10, 2021. The updates are as follows:

- A new CNAME (suffixed with .cn) will be assigned to your domain names accelerated in the Chinese mainland and over the globe.
- If you switch your domain names to acceleration outside the Chinese mainland, CNAMEs suffixed with .com are used instead.

## Notes

After the upgrade, you will see two different CNAMEs for your domain names, one suffixed with .com and the other with .cn.

1. New CNAME
   The original CNAME is still valid before you configure the new CNAME. To ensure the proper running of your business, please switch to the new CNAME ASAP.

2. CNAME changes with acceleration region

   The CNAME will change with the acceleration region. When domain names accelerated in the Chinese mainland and over the globe are switched to acceleration outside the Chinese mainland, their CNAMEs suffixed with .cdn.dnsv1.cn will be changed to CNAMEs suffixed with .cdn.dnsv1.com, and vise versa.
