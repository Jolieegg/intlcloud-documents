## Impact on Service Suspension and Resumption

The account assets of a customer are divided into two parts: credit and voucher. Their impacts on service suspension and resumption are as follows:

### 1. Impact on service suspension

When the customer's assets are insufficient, the customer's resources will be suspended, and both the customer and their reseller will receive service suspension notices.

(1) Service suspension trigger: Available credit change from **≥0** to **<0**.

(2) Service suspension process: The service will be suspended according to the lifecycle of specific products.

(3) Solution: If the customer receives a service suspension notice, they can contact their reseller to adjust the credit and vouchers to resume the resource usage.
