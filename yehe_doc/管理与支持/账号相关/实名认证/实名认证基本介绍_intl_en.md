3. Identity Verification FAQs
    3.1	Which users must complete identity verification?
    According to relevant Chinese laws and regulations, if you have selected the Chinese mainland as your service region, you must complete real-name identity verification. The Chinese mainland region does not include outlying regions of China such as Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
    3.2	What is the difference between individual and enterprise identity verification?
    Individual identity verification is needed for individual accounts. Individual accounts can be used for personal projects and operations on Tencent Cloud but cannot be used for enterprise business operations, nor can they be used to apply for special VAT invoices.
    Enterprise identity verification is needed for accounts belonging to enterprises, individually owned businesses, government or public agencies, schools, groups, or other organizations. Enterprise accounts can be used for enterprise business operations on Tencent Cloud but cannot be used for personal projects and operations. They can be used to apply for special VAT invoices.
    
    >! Identity verification directly affects the ownership of accounts and resources in Tencent Cloud. If an enterprise account uses individual identity verification, then future changes in personnel or other account issues may have an impact on the enterprise's business operations and may lead to financial losses. Before performing identity verification, make sure to confirm whether the Tencent Cloud resources you purchase are used for individual or enterprise operations.
