When you activate a pay-as-you-go service or purchase a monthly-subscribed resource, a certain amount of your available account balance will be frozen. The system estimates the amount to be frozen based on the billing cycle or order amount. The frozen amount cannot be spent and will become available after it is unfrozen.

## Frozen funds for pay-as-you-go resources

- When you purchase a pay-as-you-go service, the fee for one to two billing cycles will be frozen.

- The frozen amount will be unfrozen after the resource is released.

## Frozen funds for monthly-subscribed resources

- When you purchase a monthly-subscribed resource, the amount equivalent to the order cost will be frozen. After the resource is successfully delivered, the frozen amount will be automatically unfrozen to make the order payment.

- If the delivery fails, no payment will be made, and the frozen amount will be unfrozen and become available in your account balance.
