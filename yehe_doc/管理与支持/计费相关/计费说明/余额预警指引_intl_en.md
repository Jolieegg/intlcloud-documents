## Balance Notifications
To send you timely balance information and help ensure the continuity of your resources, the system provides three types of balance notifications: custom balance alert, available credit alert, and credit change notification.

### Custom Balance Alerts
Alert rules
- Intended for all customers.
- Alerts are triggered when your account balance is below the specified threshold.
- Only one alert is sent daily (00:00–24:00) and the alerts stop after five days.
