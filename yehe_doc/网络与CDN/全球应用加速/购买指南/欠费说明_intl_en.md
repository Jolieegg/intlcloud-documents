## Overdue Payment Policy

If your Tencent Cloud account becomes overdue, you will receive notifications through SMS, email, etc. A 2-hour grace period is provided, during which you can still use the GAAP service. GAAP service is suspended if the payment is not made within the grace period.
If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

### Overdue 
GAAP is a pay-as-you-go service that adopts prepay account freezing. The system calculates and deducts the service fee of the previous billing cycle and freezes the amount of the minimum connection fee in the available account balance. If your account balance is not enough, it goes negative and your account becomes overdue.

>! The overdue payment policy applies no matter whether the overdue payment is caused by the usage of GAAP. 

### Overdue Payment Alerts
An overdue payment alert is sent when your credit goes negative. Note that the alert is only sent once.

### Resuming GAAP
The GAAP service is resumed when the overdue payment is made within 26 hours. 
>! The acceleration connection configuration under your account will be retained for 26 hours (2-hour grace period + 24 hours).
>
> GAAP is resumed automatically once the overdue bill is paid within 26 hours.
>
> 26 hours later, your acceleration connections will be terminated and cannot be restored.
