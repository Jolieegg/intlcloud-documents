## Multi-cloud Management
Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center can integrate with all kinds of computing resources of your enterprise and manage them. It distributes Tencent Cloud services to different physical locations to reduce delay and improve service quality. The operation, governance, update and evolution of Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center are performed by Tencent Cloud in a unified way. Using container technologies as the service base of distributed environment, Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center delivers containerized applications and cloud services with cloud-native standards to provide you with lightweight, efficient, flexible and reliable open-source services.
You can manage resources on and off the cloud through [External Node Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/457/45354), [Elastic Scaling with EKS for IDC-Based Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/42975) and [Edge Cluster Service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/35390).

## Application Governance
Cloud-native applications run on multiple cloud services, and their deployment and management are performed through the same APIs and operational processes. Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center provides a uniform operation environment across multiple heterogeneous cloud infrastructures based on Kubernetes standards. You can expand Kubernetes applications from one cluster to clusters owned by different cloud vendors in multiple regions with the minimum costs.
Also, you can configure dedicated policies and application configurations for public cloud clusters, local clusters and edge clusters through Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center.

## High-Availability Disaster Recovery
High availability is available for applications in a single Kubernetes cluster, allowing the applications to continue running in case of some hardware or software failures. However, due to the distance between master nodes in the cluster, the protection for disaster events is limited. You can implement high-availability disaster recovery across the whole site or region by unified governance of applications, traffic and storage in multiple clusters.

## Automatic Release

You can manage the release, canary release and lifecycle of applications in multiple clusters on multiple cloud with the minimum costs by integrating your DevOps systems to the hub cluster in Tencent Kubernetes Engine Distributed Cloud Center. In this way, you can associate the application release logic with the underlying cluster loose coupling to expand and manage the application release, without the need to configure and initialize the clusters for development, test and production.
