TKE allows you to create different types of Kubernetes clusters with different billable items and billing standards. This document describes how to purchase different types of clusters.

## Purchasing a general cluster

In TKE, cluster management fees and cloud resource fees are charged based on the actual usage of managed clusters with different specifications. For billing details, see [TKE Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/45157).


## Purchasing a serverless cluster

EKS is billed by the CPU, GPU, and memory resources requested by workloads and the execution duration of workloads. It is suitable for different needs in different scenarios. For billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34054).


## Purchasing an edge cluster

TKE Edge charges **cluster management fees** for user-created managed cluster's control plane and **node management fees** for user-accessed compute nodes in edge clusters.
