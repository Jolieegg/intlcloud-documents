To provide better and more powerful product capabilities, TPS will be merged and upgraded into [Tencent Managed Service for Prometheus (TMP)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/46734). The new TMP service supports cross-region and cross-VPC monitoring and allows you to connect a unified Grafana dashboard to multiple TMP instances for unified data display. For TMP billing details, see [Pay-as-You-Go](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1116/43156). For cloud resource usage details, see [Billing Mode and Resource Usage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/46733). [Free metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/46735) for basic monitoring will not be billed.

TMP has been officially launched. Click [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/prometheus2) to try it out. TPS instances can no longer be created, all the legacy instances will be deactivated on May 16, 2022, and relevant resources will be deleted at that time. You can use our quick [migration tool](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/46736) to migrate your TPS instances to TMP. Before the migration, [streamline monitoring metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/46737) or reduce the collection frequency first; otherwise, higher costs may be incurred.
