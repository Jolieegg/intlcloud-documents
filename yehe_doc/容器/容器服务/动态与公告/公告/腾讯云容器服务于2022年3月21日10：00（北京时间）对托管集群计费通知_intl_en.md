Tencent Cloud plans to start charging on TKE managed clusters from **March 21, 2022 10:00 (UTC +8)**. Nine cluster models are available with different specifications, such as the maximum nodes and maximum Pods. SLA support is provided for all models. 

The new Auto Cluster Upgrade feature is released, which upgrades the cluster model automatically when the load on control plane components reaches the threshold or the number of nodes reaches the upper limit.

Tencent Cloud provides a 10-day grace period for TKE managed clusters created before 10:00, March 21, 2022 (UTC +8), which means you do not need to pay for these clusters during this period. When the grace period ends, that is 10:00, April 1, 2022 (UTC +8), you will be charged based on the chosen models. If you do not choose the model for managed clusters, a system-recommended model will apply and incur charges accordingly.

For more information about the prices, see [TKE Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/45157).
