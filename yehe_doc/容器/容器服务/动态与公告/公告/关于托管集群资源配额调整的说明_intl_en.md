TKE plans to apply a resource usage quota to managed clusters from **April 30, 2022 (UTC +8)**. This quota is automatically applied according to the cluster model, and can not be modified. It prevents the cluster from being unavailable due to excessive resource usage due to application bugs. Please check the resource usage of clusters under your account. Upgrade the cluster or delete unused resources before April 30 if necessary. For quota details, see [Quotas and Limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9087).
