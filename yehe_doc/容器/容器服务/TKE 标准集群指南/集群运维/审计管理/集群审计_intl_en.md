>? From now to June 1, 2021, users are **exempt from CLS service fees** incurred by audit log/event data generated by TKE for auto-created log topics. For details, see [Free Tier for TKE Cluster Audit and Event Log](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/37889).

## Overview
Cluster audit is a feature based on [Kubernetes Audit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit) that can store and search the records of JSON logs with configurable policies generated by kube-apiserver. This feature records the access events of kube-apiserver and records the activities of each user, admin, or system component that has an impact on the cluster in sequence.


## Advantages
The cluster audit feature provides another cluster monitoring dimension different from metrics. After cluster audit is enabled, Kubernetes can record every audit log that operates on the cluster. An audit log is a structured record in JSON format, and includes three parts: metadata, requestObject, and responseObject. The metadata (containing the request context information, such as who initiated the request, where it was initiated, and the accessed URI) is a required part. requestObject and responseObject are optional, depending on the audit level. You can learn the following information from logs:
- Activities that occur in the cluster.
- Activity occurrence time and objects.
- Activity triggering time, triggering positions, and observation points.
- Activity results and subsequent processing.

## TKE Cluster Audit Policies
### Audit level (level)
Unlike common logs, the level of Kubernetes audit logs is more like a kind of verbose configuration, which is used to indicate the degree of detail of the recorded information. There are four audit levels, as listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| None | Nothing is recorded. |
| Metadata | The metadata of the request (for example: user, time, resources, and operation) is recorded, excluding the message bodies of the request and response. |
| Request | The metadata and request message body are recorded, excluding the response message body. |
| RequestResponse | All information is recorded, including the metadata and the message bodies of the request and response. |

### Audit stage (stage)
Logs can be recorded at different stages, as listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| RequestReceived | The log is recorded when the request is received. |
| ResponseStarted | The log is recorded after the message header of the response is sent. This parameter only applies to persistent connection requests, such as watch. |
| ResponseComplete | The log is recorded after the response is completely sent. |
| Panic | The request is not completed due to an internal server error. |


### TKE audit policies
By default, TKE records audit logs when receiving requests. For most operations, audit logs of the RequestResponse level are recorded, except for the following exceptions:
- For get, list, and watch, logs of the Request level are recorded.
- For requests of secrets resources, configmaps resources, or tokenreviews resources, logs of the Metadata level are recorded.

Logs will not be recorded for the following requests:
- Requests sent by `system:kube-proxy` for monitoring endpoints resources, services resources, or services/status resources.
- get requests sent by `system:unsecured` for configmaps resources in the kube-system namespace.
- get requests sent by kubelet for nodes resources or nodes/status resources.
- get requests sent by any identity in `system:nodes` for nodes resources or nodes/status resources.
- get and update requests sent by `system:kube-controller-manager`, `system:kube-scheduler`, or `system:serviceaccount:endpoint-controller` for endpoint resources in the kube-system namespace.
- get requests sent by `system:apiserver` for namespaces resources, namespaces/status resources, or namespaces/finalize resources.
- Requests sent to URLs that match `/healthz*`, `/version`, or ` /swagger*`.


## Directions 
### Enabling cluster audit
>! 
>- To enable the cluster audit feature, you need to restart kube-apiserver. We recommend that you do not frequently enable and disable the feature.
>- A self-deployed cluster occupies about 1 Gib of local storage on the master node. Please ensure that the storage of the master node is sufficient.

1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).
2. Choose **Cluster OPS** > **Feature Management** in the left sidebar to go to the **Feature Management** page.
3. At the top of the **Feature Management** page, select a region. Click **Set** next to the cluster for which you want to enable cluster audit, as shown in the figure below.

4. In the "Configure a Feature" window that appears, click **Edit** next to the "Cluster Audit" feature.

5. Select **Enable Cluster Audit** and select the logset and log topic for storing audit logs. It is recommended to select **Automatically Create a Log Topic**.
