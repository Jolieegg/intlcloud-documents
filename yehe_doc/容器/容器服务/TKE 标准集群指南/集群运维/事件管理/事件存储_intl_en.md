## Overview

Kubernetes Events contains information about the operations of Kubernetes clusters and the scheduling of various resources, which can help Ops personnel monitor daily changes in resources and locate problems. TKE supports event persistence for all clusters. After enabling this feature, your cluster events will be exported to the configured storage in real time. TKE also supports the search of event flows by using PAAS services provided by Tencent Cloud or open-source software tools. This document describes how to enable persistent storage of cluster events.
