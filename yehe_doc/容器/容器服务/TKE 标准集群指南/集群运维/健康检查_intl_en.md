## Overview
The cluster health check feature is a service provided by Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) for checking the status and health of each resource in a cluster. The resulting check report displays the detailed status and configuration of components, nodes, workloads, and other check items. If an exception is detected, this feature can describe the exception in detail, automatically analyze the severity, cause, and impact, and propose rectification suggestions.
>! During the health check, namespace **tke-cluster-inspection** will be automatically created in your cluster, and a Daemonset will be installed to collect node information. Both objects will be automatically deleted after the health check is completed.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Tencent Kubernetes Engine console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and choose **Cluster OPS** > **Health Check** in the left sidebar.
2. On the **Health Check** page that appears, select the health check mode for the cluster.   
    In the Health Check page, thereâ€™re three options: Batch Check, Check Now, and Auto Check.
 - **Batch Check**: simultaneously checks multiple clusters.
 - **Check Now**: checks only one cluster.
 - **Auto Check**: enables periodic health check for the cluster.
