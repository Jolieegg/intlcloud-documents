## Overview

A StatefulSet is used to manage stateful applications. A Pod created by a StatefulSet has a persistent identifier that is created according to the specifications. The identifier will be retained after the Pod is migrated, terminated, or restarted. When using persistent storage, you can map storage volumes to identifiers. If your application does not require any persistent identifier, we recommend that you use a Deployment to deploy the application.

## Operation Guide for StatefulSets in the Console


### Creating a StatefulSet[](id:createStatefulSet)
1. Log in to the TKE console and select **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** in the left sidebar.
2. Click the ID of the cluster where StatefulSet needs to be created to enter the cluster management page.
3. Choose **Workload** > **StatefulSet** to go to the StatefulSet management page, as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/88ece12d8464711824eadfb35db0c050.png)
4. Click **Create** to open the **Create Workload** page.
Set the StatefulSet parameters as needed. Key parameters are as follows:
 - **Workload**: enter the customized name.
 - **Label**: a key-value pair, which is used for classified management of resources.
 - **Namespace**: select a namespace based on your requirements.
 - **Type**: Select **StatefulSet (run the Pod in a stateful manner)**.
 - **Volume (optional)**: provides storage for the container. It can be a temp path, CVM path, CBS volume, file storage NFS, configuration file and PVC, and it must be mounted to the specified path of the container.
 - **Containers in the Pod**: set one or more different containers for a Pod of the StatefulSet as needed.
    - **Name**: custom.
    - **Image**: select as needed.
    - **Image tag**: fill as needed.
    - **Image Pull Policy**: the following three policies are available. Select as needed.
       If you do not set any image pull policy and **Image Tag** is left empty or `latest`, the `Always` policy is used. Otherwise, the `IfNotPresent` policy is used.
        - **Always**: always pull the image from the remote end.
        - **IfNotPresent**: a local image is used by default. If no local image is available, the image is pulled remotely.
        - **Never**: only use a local image. If no local image is available, an exception occurs.
    - **CPU/memory limits**: set the CPU and memory limit according to [Kubernetes' resource limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/) to improve the robustness of the business.
    - **GPU Resource**: you can configure the least GPU resource used by the workload.
    - **Advanced settings**: parameters such as "**working directory**", "**run commands**", "**run parameters**", "**container health check**", and "**privilege level**" can be set.
 - **Image Access Credential**: a container image is private by default. You need to select the image access credential for the TCR instance when creating a workload.
 - **Number of Pods**: select the adjustment method and set the number of Pods based on actual needs.
 - **Node Scheduling Policy**: the Pod can be scheduled to the node of the Label that meets the expectation according to the scheduling rules.
 - **Access Settings**: set Service parameters according to actual needs. For more information, see [Service Access](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/36832).
5. Click **Create Workload** to complete the process.

5. On the **Update a StatefulSet** page, edit the YAML and click **Done** to update the YAML.

#### Updating Pod configuration
1. On the cluster management page, click the ID of the StatefulSet cluster for which the Pod configuration needs to be updated to enter the StatefulSet cluster management page.

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/aa939dc1637fa6f92c1521b43fb29cf9.png)
3. On the **Update Pod Configuration** page, modify the updating method and set parameters as needed, as shown below:

4. Click **Done** to update the Pod configuration.

## Using Kubectl to Manipulate StatefulSets


### YAML sample[](id:YAMLSample)

```Yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service ## Create a Headless Service to control the network domain
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet ### Create a Nginx StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3 # by default is 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "cbs"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```
- **kind**: this identifies the StatefulSet resource type.
- **metadata**: basic information such as StatefulSet name and Label.
- **metadata.annotations**: an additional description of the StatefulSet. You can set additional enhancements to TKE through this parameter.
- **spec.template**: detailed template configuration of the Pod managed by the StatefulSet.
- **spec.volumeClaimTemplates**: provides a templates for creating PVCs and PVs.

For more details about the parameters, see [Kubernetes' official document about StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

### Creating a StatefulSet

1. Prepare the StatefulSet YAML file as instructed by [YAML sample](#YAMLSample).
2. Install kubectl and connect to a cluster. For detailed operations, see [Connecting to a Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30639).
3. Run the following command to create the StatefulSet YAML file.
```shell
kubectl create -f <StatefulSet YAML filename>
```
For example, to create a StatefulSet YAML file named web.yaml, run the following command:
```shell
kubectl create -f web.yaml
```
4. Run the following command to check whether the Job is successfully created.
```shell
kubectl get StatefulSet
```
If a message similar to the following is returned, the creation is successful.
```
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
test      1         1         10s
```

### Updating a StatefulSet

Run the following command to view the update policy type of the StatefulSet.
```
kubectl get ds/<daemonset-name> -o go-template='{{.spec.updateStrategy.type}}{{"\n"}}'
```
StatefulSet has the following two update policy types:
â€“OnDelete: the default upgrade policy. With this policy, after the StatefulSet is updated, you have to manually delete the old StatefulSet Pod to create a new one.
- RollingUpdate: Kubernetes 1.7 or later is supported. With this policy, after the StatefulSet template is updated, the old StatefulSet Pod will be terminated, and a new StatefulSet Pod will be created in a rolling update manner (only for Kubernetes v1.7 or later).

#### Method 1

Run the following command to update a StatefulSet.
```
kubectl edit StatefulSet/[name]
```
This method applies to simple debugg verification. It is not recommended to use it in production environments. You can update any StatefulSet parameters in this way.

#### Method 2

Run the following command to update the image of the specified container.
```
kubectl patch statefulset <NAME> --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"<newImage>"}]'
```
It is recommended to keep other StatefulSet parameters unchanged and only update the container image when the business is updated.

If the StatefulSet is roll updated, you can view the update status by running the following command:
```
kubectl rollout status sts/<StatefulSet-name>
```

### Deleting a StatefulSet

Run the following command to delete a StatefulSet.
```
kubectl delete  StatefulSet [NAME] --cascade=false
```
The --cascade=false parameter indicates that Kubernetes only deletes the StatefulSet but not the Pods. Run the following command if you need to delete Pod.
```
kubectl delete StatefulSet [NAME]
```
