### qGPU Strengths

- **Flexibility:** Finely configure GPU computing capacity and vRAM size.
- ****Strong isolation:** vRAM and computing power can be strictly isolated.
- **Hybrid deployment:** Supports online and offline hybrid deployment to maximize the GPU utilization.
- **Coverage:** Supports popular architectures including Volta (such as V100), Turing (such as T4) and Ampere (such as A100 and A10).
- **Cloud nativeness:** Standard Kubernetes and NVIDIA Docker solutions are supported.
- **Compatibility:** No need to rewrite application code or replace CUDA libraries, and it is easily deployed in a way imperceptible to the application.
- **High performance:** Virtualization is applied at the underlying layer of GPU devices, realizing efficient convergence and nearly zero loss of throughput.
