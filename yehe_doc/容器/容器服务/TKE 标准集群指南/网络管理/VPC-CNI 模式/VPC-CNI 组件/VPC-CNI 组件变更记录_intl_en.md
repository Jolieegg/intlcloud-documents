The VPC-CNI component contains three Kubernetes cluster components: `tke-eni-agent`, `tke-eni-ipamd`, and `tke-eni-ip-scheduler`. Generally, their versions are the same. However, `tke-eni-ip-scheduler` is less modified, so its version may be a little earlier.

## Checking the Component Version

The component version is the image tag. You can check it via the kubernetes API.
```
# Checking the version of tke-eni-agent
kubectl -nkube-system get ds tke-eni-agent -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
# Checking the version of tke-eni-ipamd
kubectl -nkube-system get deploy tke-eni-ipamd -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
# Checking the version of tke-eni-ip-scheduler
kubectl -nkube-system get deploy tke-eni-ip-scheduler -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
```
