## Scenario

This document guides you through the process of removing a node from a cluster.

## Considerations

- A pay-as-you-go node can be retained or terminated as needed, but if it is not terminated, fees will continue to be incurred.
- Keep in mind that if a node is removed from and then added back to the cluster, the system will be reinstalled.

## Directions
1. Log in to the TKE console and select **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** in the left sidebar.
2. In the Cluster Management list page, click the ID/name of the cluster of the node to be removed to go to the Deployment page, as shown below:

5. In the node list, select the row of the node to be removed and click **Remove**.
6. When the "Are you sure you want to remove the following nodes?" window pops up, click **OK** to complete the removal.
