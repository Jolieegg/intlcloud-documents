## Image Building FAQs

### How do I specify the Dockerfile path and building directory when building an image by using source code?
- If you do not enter a path, the system uses the following default values:
 - Default Dockerfile path: Dockerfile under the root directory of the repository (`Dockerfile`).
 - Default building directory: root directory of the repository (`./`).
- To specify a path, **enter a relative path with the project path as the root path**, as shown in the following figure:

### How does the source code building feature use the Dockerfile path and building directory?
Clone the user-specified repository, then switch to the corresponding branch or tag, and lastly run the command `docker build -f $DOCKERFILE_PATH $WORKDIR` in the root directory of the code repository to build a container image.

### How do I specify the source path in Dockerfile?
For `COPY`, `ADD`, and other commands related to the source path, specify the source path as a path relative to the building directory.
