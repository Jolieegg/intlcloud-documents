It is easy to deploy containerized services to a Kubernetes cluster. If a service is used in a formal production environment, you need to select a solution and adjust the configuration based on the service scenario and deployment environment. For example, you need to set the container request and limit to ensure high availability of the deployed service, configure health check and auto scaling to better schedule resources, and select persistent storage and external service disclosure.

You can refer to the following documents to deploy Kubernetes services and adjust configurations based on actual requirements:
