## Overview

This document describes how to host a Spring Cloud application to TKE.  

**Hosting Spring Cloud applications to TKE has the following advantages:**

- Improve the resource utilization.  
- Kubernetes is a natural fit for microservice architectures.  
- Improve the Ops efficiency and facilitate DevOps implementation.  
- Highly scalable Kubernetes makes it easy to dynamically scale applications.  
- TKE provides Kubernetes master management to ease Kubernetes cluster Ops and management.  
- TKE is integrated with other cloud-native products of Tencent Cloud to help you better use Tencent Cloud products.  

## Best Practices

### PiggyMetrics overview 

This document describes how to host a Spring Cloud application to TKE by forking the open-source [PiggyMetrics](https://github.com/sqshq/piggymetrics) on GitHub and adapting it to Tencent Cloud products.  

>?The modified PiggyMetrics deployment project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TencentCloud/container-demo/tree/main/springcloud-on-tke). After [creating the basic service cluster](#create), you can download the deployment project and deploy it in TKE.  



The PiggyMetrics homepage is as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/40a504b665b76ab16e32394f2594350f.jpg)

PiggyMetrics is a microservice-architecture application for personal finances developed by using the Spring Cloud framework.  

PiggyMetrics consists of the following microservices:


| Microservice              | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| API gateway            | It's a Spring Cloud Zuul-based gateway and the aggregated portal for calling backend APIs, providing reverse routing and load balancing (Eureka + Ribbon) as well as rate limiting (Hystrix). Client single-page applications and the Zuul gateway are deployed together to simplify deployment.  |
| Service registration and discovery      | A Spring Cloud Eureka registry. Business services are registered through Eureka when they are enabled, and service discovery is performed through Eureka when services are called.    |
| Authorization and authentication service        | An authorization and authentication center based on Spring Security OAuth2. The client gets the access token through the Auth Service during logins, and so does service call. Each resource server verifies the token through the Auth Service.    |
| Configuration service            | A configuration center based on Spring Cloud Config to centrally manage configuration files for all Spring services.  |
| Soft loading and rate limiting    | Ribbon and Hystrix based on Spring Cloud. Zuul calls backend services through Ribbon for soft loading and Hystrix for rate limiting.   |
| Metrics and dashboard | Hystrix Dashboard based on Spring Cloud Turbine, aggregating all the PiggyMetrics streams generated by Hystrix and displaying them on the Hystrix Dashboard.  |






### PiggyMetrics deployment architecture and add-ons[](id:deploy)


In the following best practice, applications deployed in CVM are containerized and hosted to TKE. In this use case, one VPC is used and divided into two subnets:

- **Subnet-Basic** is deployed with stateful basic services, including Dubbo's service registry Nacos, MySQL, and Redis.  
- **Subnet-K8S** is deployed with PiggyMetrics application services, all of which are containerized and run in TKE.  

The VPC is divided as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/655ab40fd69c101c8566c083a54b6ecf.png)

The network planning for the PiggyMetrics instance is as shown below:

| Network Planning          | Description                                                         |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Region/AZ       | Nanjing/Nanjing Zone 1                                              |
| VPC               | CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16                                            |
| Subnet-Basic | Nanjing Zone 1, CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24                                  |

## Overview


### TCR

Tencent Cloud [Tencent Container Registry (TCR)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/products/tcr) are available in Personal Edition and Enterprise Edition as differentiated below:

- TCR Personal Edition is only deployed in Guangzhou, while TCR Enterprise Edition is deployed in every region.  
- TCR Personal Edition doesn't offer SLA guarantee.  

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/c7d26313cc3b20f4a8a4494ceacc8979.png)


PiggyMetrics is a Dubbo containerized demo project, so TCR Personal Edition perfectly meets its needs. However, for enterprise users, [TCR Enterprise Edition](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcr) is recommended. To use an image repository, see [Basic Image Repository Operations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1051/35488).  



### TSW

Tencent Service Watcher (TSW) provides cloud-native service observability solutions that can trace upstream and downstream dependencies in distributed architectures, draw topologies, and provide multidimensional call observation by service, API, instance, and middleware.  
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/696575e18efc41ab787ce5c30aac3fa7.png)

TSW is architecturally divided into four modules:
<dx-accordion>
::: Data collection (client)
You can use an open-source probe or SDK to collect data. If you are migrating to the cloud, you can change the reporting address and authentication information only and keep most of the configurations on the client.  
:::
::: Data processing (server)
  Data is reported to the server via the Pulsar message queue, converted by the adapter into an OpenTracing-compatible format, and assigned to real-time and offline computing as needed.
	- Real-time computing provides real-time monitoring, statistical data display, and fast response to the connected alarming platform.  
	- Offline computing aggregates the statistical data in large amounts over long periods of time and leverages big data analytics to provide business value.  
	:::
	::: Storage
	The storage layer can adapt to use cases with different data types, writing at the server layer, and query and reading requests at the data usage layer.  
	:::
	::: Data usage
	The data usage layer provides underlying support for console operations, data display, and alarming.  
	:::
	</dx-accordion><br>

The architecture is as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/d54ef1a1ea251bf4dd7d897796eed626.png)



## Directions

### Creating basic service cluster[](id:create)

- In the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb), create an instance and run the following command to initialize it:
  <dx-codeblock>
  :::  sh

# Download the MongoDB client, decompress it, and enter the `bin` directory.

wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.18.tgz
tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.18.tgz
cd mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.6.18/bin

# Run the following command to initialize MongoDB, where `mongouser` is the admin account created when the MongoDB instance is created.

./mongo -u mongouser -p --authenticationDatabase "admin" [mongodb IP]/piggymetrics mongo-init.js
:::
</dx-codeblock>
 <dx-alert infotype="explain" title=" ">
  A **guest** user of the `piggymetrics` library is created in the MongoDB initialization script **mongo-init.js** by default, which can be modified as needed.  
</dx-alert>

- In the [CLB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb), create a private network CLB instance for `Subnet-K8S` (the ID of this CLB instance will be used later).  
- TSW is currently in beta test and supports both Java and Go.  







### Building Docker image

#### Writing Dockerfile

The following uses `account-service` as an example to describe how to write a Dockerfile. The project directory structure of `account-service` is displayed, **Dockerfile** is in the root directory of the project, and **account-service.jar** is the packaged file that needs to be added to the image.  

```sh
➜  account-service tree
├── Dockerfile
├── skywalking
│   ├── account.config
│   └── skywalking-agent.zip
├── pom.xml
├── src
│    ....
├── target
│    .....
│   └── account-service.jar
└── account-service.iml
```


>? Here, SkyWalking Agent is used as the TSW access client that reports call chain information to the TSW backend. For more information on how to download SkyWalking Agent, see [PiggyMetrics deployment architecture and add-ons](#deploy).  

The Dockerfile of `account-service` is as shown below:

<dx-codeblock>
:::  docker
FROM java:8-jre

# Working directory in the container 

/appWORKDIR /app

# Add the locally packaged application to the image.

ADD ./target/account-service.jar

# Copy SkyWalking Agent to the image.

COPY ./skywalking/skywalking-agent.zip 

# Decompress SkyWalking Agent and delete the original compressed file.

RUN unzip skywalking-agent.zip && rm -f skywalking-agent.zip

# Add the SkyWalking configuration file.

COPY ./skywalking/account.config ./skywalking-agent/config/agent.config

# Start the application.

CMD ["java", "-Xmx256m", "-javaagent:/app/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar", "-jar", "/app/account-service.jar"]

# Port description of the application

EXPOSE 6000
:::
</dx-codeblock>


>! As each Run command in the Dockerfile will generate an image layer, we recommend you combine these commands into one.  







#### Image build


TCR provides both automatic and manual methods to build an image. For more information, see [Image Building Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1051/39846). To demonstrate the build process, the manual method is used.  

The image name needs to be in line with the convention of `ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/[namespace]/[ImageName]:[image tag]`:

- Here, `namespace` can be the project name to facilitate image management and use. In this document, `piggymetrics` represents all the images under the PiggyMetrics project.  
- `ImageName` can contain the `subpath`, generally used for multi-project use cases of enterprise users. In addition, if a local image is already built, you can run the `docker tag` command to rename the image in line with the naming convention.  



1. Run the following command to build an image as shown below:
   <dx-codeblock>
   :::  sh

# Recommended build method, which eliminates the need for secondary tagging operations

sudo docker build -t ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/[namespace]/[ImageName]:[image tag]

# Build a local `account-service` image. The last `.` indicates that the Dockerfile is stored in the current directory (`account-service`).

➜  account-service docker build -t ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/piggymetrics/account-service:1.0.0 .

# Rename existing images in line with the naming convention

sudo docker tag [ImageId] ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/[namespace]/[ImageName]:[image tag]
:::
</dx-codeblock>

2. After the build is complete, you can run the following command to view all the images in your local repository.  
```sh
docker images | grep piggymetrics
```
 A sample is as shown below:
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/64ebfe03265b1d95ebe6bb5a3cf02bf1.png)





### Uploading image to TCR


#### Creating namespace

The PiggyMetrics project uses TCR Personal Edition (TCR Enterprise Edition is recommended for enterprise users).  


1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).  
2. Click **TCR** > **Personal** > **Namespace** to enter the **Namespace** page.  
3. Click **Create** and create the `piggymetrics` namespace in the pop-up window. All the images of the PiggyMetrics project are stored under this namespace as shown below:
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/05dcf306b130329026917b6e7ef4e910.png)



#### Uploading image

Log in to TCR and upload an image.  


1. Run the following command to log in to TCR.  
```sh
 docker login --username=[Tencent Cloud account ID] ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
```
 <dx-alert infotype="explain" title=" ">

- You can get your Tencent Cloud account ID on the [Account Info](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer) page.  
- If you forget your **TCR login password**, you can reset it in [My Images](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/registry/user) of TCR Personal Edition.  
  ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/851c154953fdfffdba376c74ea6bc05e.png)
- If you are prompted that you have no permission to run the command, add `sudo` before the command and run it as shown below. In this case, you need to enter two passwords, the server admin password required for `sudo` and the **TCR login password**.  

```sh
 sudo docker login --username=[Tencent Cloud account ID] ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
```As shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d34997020efabeb1f52f3eb9327f20cb.png)
</dx-alert>
2. Run the following command to push the locally generated image to TCR.  
```sh
docker push ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/[namespace]/[ImageName]:[image tag]
```
 As shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/466adcd0ebf9adf2c16421885a0c6567.png)
3. In [My Images](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/registry/user/self?rid=1), you can view all the uploaded images.  
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title=" ">
The default image type is `Private`. If you want to let others use the image, you can set it to `Public` in **Image Info** as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/3e428c35e023c4b08880c4603dc9e38a.png)
</dx-alert>




### Deploying service in TKE

#### Creating K8s cluster PiggyMetrics

1. Before the deployment, you need to create a K8s cluster as instructed in [Quickly Creating a Standard Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/40029).  
>!When a cluster is created, we recommend you enable **Placement Group** on the **Select Model** page. It helps distribute CVM instances across different hosts to increase the system reliability.
2. After the cluster is created, you can view its information on the [Cluster Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster) page in the TKE console. Here, the new cluster is named `piggyMetrics`.
3. Click the `PiggyMetrics-k8s-demo` cluster to enter the **Basic Info** page to view the cluster configuration information.  
4. (Optional) If you want to use K8s management tools such as kubectl and Lens, you need to follow two steps:
	1. Enable public network access.  
	2. Store the API authentication token in the local `config` file under `user home/.kube` (choose another if the `config` file has content) to ensure that the default cluster can be accessed each time. If you choose not to store the token in the `config` file under `.kube`, see the **Instructions on Connecting to Kubernetes Cluster via kubectl** under **Cluster API Server Info** in the console as shown below:
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/5c6d54faa2636a8f72cff293e1d04f9a.png)



#### Creating namespace

A namespace is a logical environment in a Kubernetes cluster, allowing you to divide teams or projects. You can create a namespace in the following three methods, and method 1 is recommended.  


<dx-tabs>
::: Method 1. Use the command line
Run the following command to create a namespace:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  sh
kubectl create namespace piggymetrics
:::
</dx-codeblock>
:::
::: Method 2. Use the console
1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and click the **Cluster ID/Name** to enter the cluster details page.  
2. Click **Namespace** > **Create** to create a namespace named `PiggyMetrics`.  
:::
::: Method 3. Use YAML
Run the following command to create a namespace with YAML:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  sh
kubctl create –f namespace.yaml
:::
</dx-codeblock>Here, `namespace.yaml` is as shown below: 
<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
  # Create the `piggymetrics` namespace.
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata: 
    name: piggymetrics
  spec: 
    finalizers:
    - kubernetes
:::
</dx-codeblock>
:::
</dx-tabs>




#### Using ConfigMap to store configuration information

ConfigMap allows you to decouple the configuration from the running image, making the application more portable. The PiggyMetrics backend service needs to get the MongoDB host and port information from the environment variables and store them by using the ConfigMap.  
You can use ConfigMap to store configuration information in the following two methods:

<dx-tabs>
::: Method 1. Use YAML
The following is the ConfigMap YAML for PiggyMetrics, where **values of pure digits require double quotation marks**.  
<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
# Create a ConfigMap.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: 
  name: piggymetrics-env
  namespace: piggymetrics
data: 
  # MongoDB IP address
  MONGODB_HOST: 10.0.1.13 
  # TSW access address as described below
  SW_AGENT_COLLECTOR_BACKEND_SERVICES: ap-shanghai.tencentservicewatcher.com:11800
:::
</dx-codeblock>
:::
::: Method 2. Use the console
1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and click the **Cluster ID/Name** to enter the cluster details page.  
2. Click **Configuration Management** > **ConfigMap** > **Create** to create a ConfigMap named `piggymetrics-env` for storing the configuration. The `piggymetrics` namespace is as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/e4429a28b01c2a65b9efa1407b056a2f.png)
:::
</dx-tabs>



#### Using Secret to store sensitive information

A Secret can be used to store sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, and keys to reduce exposure risks. PiggyMetrics uses it to store account and password information.  
You can use a Secret to store sensitive information in the following two methods:


<dx-tabs>
::: Method 1. Use YAML
The following is the YAML for creating a Secret in PiggyMetrics, where the `value` of the Secret needs to be a Base64-encoded string.  
<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
# Create a Secret.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata: 
  name: piggymetrics-keys
  namespace: piggymetrics
  labels: 
    qcloud-app: piggymetrics-keys
data: 
  # Replace `XXX` below with the actual value.
  MONGODB_USER: XXX
  MONGODB_PASSWORD: XXX
  SW_AGENT_AUTHENTICATION: XXX
type: Opaque
:::
</dx-codeblock>
:::
::: Method 2. Use the console
1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2) and click the **Cluster ID/Name** to enter the cluster details page.  
2. Click **Configuration Management** > **Secret** > **Create** to create a Secret named `piggymetrics-keys` as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/1d59459f5f288c044953a4c10f508fc3.png)
:::
</dx-tabs>





#### Deploying stateful service with StatefulSet

A StatefulSet is used to manage stateful applications. A Pod created accordingly has a persistent identifier in line with the specifications, which will be retained after the Pod is migrated, terminated, or restarted. When using persistent storage, you can map storage volumes to identifiers.  
The basic add-ons and services under the PiggyMetrics project such as configuration services, registry, and RabbitMQ have their own data stored and are therefore suitable for deployment through StatefulSet.  

Below is a sample deployment YAML for `config-server`:


<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata: 
  name: config-server
  namespace: piggymetrics
spec: 
  clusterIP: None
  ports: 
    - name: http
      port: 8888
      targetPort: 8888
      protocol: TCP
  selector: 
    app: config
    version: v1

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata: 
  name: config
  namespace: piggymetrics
  labels: 
    app: config
    version: v1

  serviceName: "config-server"
  replicas: 1
  selector: 
    matchLabels: 
      app: config
      version: v1
  template: 
    metadata: 
      labels: 
        app: config
        version: v1
    spec: 
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers: 
        - name: config
          image: ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/piggymetrics/config-server:2.0.03
          ports: 
            - containerPort: 8888
              protocol: TCP
:::
</dx-codeblock>



#### Deploying Deployment

A Deployment declares the Pod template and controls the Pod running policy, which is suitable for deploying stateless applications. PiggyMetrics backend services such as Account are stateless and can use the Deployment.  

YAML parameters for the `account-service` Deployment are as follows:

| Parameter             | Description                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| replicas         | Indicates the number of Pods to be created.                                      |
| image            | Image address                                                   |
| imagePullSecrets | The key to pull an image, which can be obtained from **[Cluster](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/)** > **Configuration Management** > **Secret**. It is not required for public images. |
| env              | <li>Defines Pod environment variables and values.<br><li>The `key-value` defined in the ConfigMap can be referenced by using `configMapKeyRef`.<br><li>The `key-value` defined in the Secret can be referenced by using `secretKeyRef`. |
| ports            | Specifies the port number of the container. It is `6000` for `account-service`.       |


Below is a complete sample YAML file for the `account-service` Deployment:

<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
# account-service Deployment

#### Deploying Service

You can specify the Service type with Kubernetes `ServiceType`, which defaults to `ClusterIP`. Valid values of `ServiceType` include the following:

- LoadBalancer: Provides public network, VPC, and private network access.  
- NodePort: : Accesses services through the CVM IP and host port.  
- ClusterIP: Accesses services through the service name and port.  


The frontend pages and the gateway of PiggyMetrics are packaged together and need to provide services, so `ServiceType` is set to `LoadBalancer`. TKE enriches the `LoadBalancer` mode by configuring the Service through annotations.  

If you use the `service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-loadbalancer-internal-subnetid` annotations, a private network CLB instance will be created when the Service is deployed. In general, we recommend you create the CLB instance in advance and use the `service.kubernetes.io/loadbalance-id` annotations in the deployment YAML to improve the efficiency.  

Below is the deployment YAML for `gateway service`:


<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
# Deploy `gateway service`.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
  name: gateway
  namespace: piggymetrics
  annotations: 
    # Replace it with the ID of the CLB instance of `Subnet-K8S`.
    service.kubernetes.io/loadbalance-id: lb-hfyt76co
spec: 
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports: 
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 4000
      protocol: TCP
  selector: # Map the backend `gateway` to the Service.
    app: gateway
    version: v1
  type: LoadBalancer
:::
</dx-codeblock>



#### Viewing deployment result

At this point, you have completed the deployment of PiggyMetrics in TKE and can view the deployment result in the following steps:

1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/) and click the **Cluster ID/Name** to enter the cluster details page.  
2. Click **Services and Routes** > **Service** to enter the **Service** page, where you can see the created Service. You can access the PiggyMetrics page through the `gateway service` VIP.  




### Integrating CLS

#### Enabling container log collection

The container log collection feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled as instructed below:

1. Log in to the TKE console and click **Cluster Ops** > **[Feature Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/ops/list?rid=1)** on the left sidebar.  
2. At the top of the **Feature Management** page, select the region. On the right of the target cluster, click **Set**.  
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/018b15f5486495a891fad0fe20ca8977.png)
3. On the **Configure Features** page, click **Edit** for log collection, enable log collection, and confirm this operation as shown below:
 ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/ea025c4b7d34dd46684b1ccbf0e29486.png)





#### Creating log topic and logset

CLS is region-specific. To reduce the network latency, we recommend you select a region closest to your business when creating log resources, which are mainly logsets and log topics. A logset represents a project, a log topic represents a class of services, and a single logset can contain multiple log topics.  

PiggyMetrics is deployed in Nanjing region, so you need to select Nanjing region on the **Log Topic** page when creating logsets:
1. Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/logset) and select Nanjing region on the **Log Topic** page.  
2. Click **Create Log Topic** and enter the relevant information in the pop-up window as prompted as shown below:
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/d38a913cfa00426a70828624cc0bf5a0.png)
	- **Log Topic Name**: Enter `piggymetrics`.  
	- **Logset Operation**: Select **Create Logset**.  
	- **Logset Name**: Enter `piggymetrics-logs`.  
3. Click **OK**.  
>?As PiggyMetrics has multiple backend microservices, you can create a log topic for each microservice to facilitate log categorization.  
>- A log topic is created for each PiggyMetrics service.  
>- You need the log topic ID when creating log rules for containers.  



#### Configuring log collection rule

You can configure container log collection rules in the console or with CRD.  


<dx-tabs>
::: Method 1. Use the console
Log rules specify the location of a log in a container:
1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/) and click **Cluster Ops** > **Log Rules** on the left sidebar.  
2. On the **Log Rules** page, click **Create** to create a rule.
	- **Log Source**: Specify the location of a log in a container. PiggyMetrics uses the default Spring Cloud configuration where all logs are printed to the standard output. Therefore, you can use the standard container output and specify a Pod Label.  
	- **Consumer**: Select the previously created logset and topic.  
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/5a2bea6070667f138dae51ae3fb9fb18.png)
3. Click **Next** to enter the **Log Parsing Method**. Here, single-line text is used for PiggyMetrics. For more information on the log formats supported by CLS, see [Full Text in a Single Line](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32287).  
:::
::: Method 2. Use CRD
You can also configure log collection rules via Custom Resource Definition (CRD). PiggyMetrics uses a container file path for collection and single-line text. The following is a configuration YAML for `account-service` log collection. For more information on CRD collection configuration, see [Using CRD to Configure Log Collection via YAML](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/43936).  
<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
apiVersion: cls.cloud.tencent.com/v1
kind: LogConfig
metadata: 
    name: account-log-rule
spec: 
    clsDetail: 
    extractRule: {}
    # Single-line text
    logType: minimalist_log
    # Log topic ID
    topicId: 8438cc9b-888f-469f-9cff-9891270a0a13
    inputDetail: 
    # Standard container output
    containerStdout: 
      container: account-service
      includeLabels: 
        app: account-service
        version: v1
      namespace: piggymetrics
    type: container_stdout
:::
</dx-codeblock>

</dx-tabs>





#### Viewing log

1. Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/search) and enter the **Search and Analysis** page.  
2. On the **Search and Analysis** page, **Create Index** for the logs first and then click **Search and Analysis** to view the logs.  
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9a33c5aff99b875f43a6892bbaa62555.png)
>!You can't find logs if no indexes are created.  



### Integrating TSW


TSW is currently in beta test and can be deployed in Guangzhou and Shanghai. Here, deployment in Shanghai is used as an example (PiggyMetrics is deployed in Nanjing).  


#### Accessing TSW - getting access point information

1. Log in to the [TSW console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apm) and click **Service Observation** > **Service List** on the left sidebar.  
2. Click **Access Service** and select Java and the SkyWalking data collection method. The access method provides the **Access Point** and **Token** information.  


#### Accessing TSW - application and container configuration

Enter the **Access Point** and **Token** of the TSW obtained in the previous step in `collector.backend_service` and `agent.authentication` respectively in the `agent.config` of SkyWalking. `agent.service_name` is the service name, and `agent.namespace` can be used to group microservices under the same domain. `account-service` configuration is as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/905e1c628fdc2c2d5978fb53abf548bf.png)

You can also configure SkyWalking Agent by using environment variables. PiggyMetrics uses the ConfigMap and Secret to configure environment variables:
- Use the ConfigMap to configure `SW_AGENT_COLLECTOR_BACKEND_SERVICES`.
- Use the Secret to configure `SW_AGENT_AUTHENTICATION`.

As shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8754378056b4627fc6a4699a606c050d.png)

At this point, you have completed TSW access. After starting the container service, you can view the call chain, service topology, and SQL analysis in the [TSW console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apm).  


### Using TSW

#### Viewing call exception through service API or call chain


1. Log in to the [TSW console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apm) and click **Service Observation** > **API Observation** on the left sidebar.  
2. On the **API Observation** page, you can view the call status of all APIs under a service, including the number of requests, success rate, error rate, response time, and other metrics.
The figure shows that the gateway and `account-service` responded too slowly and all `statistic-service` requests failed in the past hour.  
3. Click the service name `statistics-service` to enter the information page. Click **API Observation**, and you can see that the API `{PUT}/{accountName}` throws a `NestedServletException` exception, which makes the API unavailable.
4. Click the **Trace ID** to view the call chain details.



#### Viewing service topology

1. Log in to the [TSW console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apm) and click **Chain Tracing** > **Distributed Dependency Topology** on the left sidebar.  
2. On the **Distributed Dependency Topology** page, you can view the completed service dependencies as well as information such as the number of calls and average latency.
