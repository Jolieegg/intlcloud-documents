Tencent Cloud allows you to purchase TCR Enterprise Edition instances either from the console or via API.


## Purchasing via Console

### Purchasing pay-as-you-go instances
1. Log in to the [TCR purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/tcr).
2. Set the name, region, and specification of the TCR Enterprise Edition instance.
3. Select **Pay as you go** for the **Billing Mode**.
4. Click **Buy Now** and complete the payment as prompted in the page.
 After the payment is completed, you can log in to the [TCR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcr/instance?rid=1) to use it.



## Purchasing via an API
You can use the `CreateInstance` API to create a TCR Enterprise Edition instance. For more information, see [CreateInstance](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1051/50715).
