## Exclusiveness in the Cloud
You can quickly create a repository and push or pull container images without needing to build or maintain the image hosting service. A TCR Enterprise Edition instance has an exclusive service backend and backend storage. Compared with other shared image hosting platforms, such as DockerHub, TCR Enterprise Edition instances are exclusive to a single tenant. You do not need to worry about the influence of other users or use restrictions. TCR Enterprise Edition can ensure your data security and privacy.


## Worldwide Synchronization
TCR can be deployed in multiple regions worldwide. With TCR Enterprise Edition, you can customize rules to synchronize container images and Helm charts across regions worldwide. TCR meets the needs of enterprise container users for pulling container images from the nearest region when they expand business worldwide and implementing cross-region disaster recovery.

## Security and Compliance
A TCR Enterprise Edition instance has an exclusive cloud storage backend. Container images and Helm charts are stored in your COS bucket after being encrypted. TCR Enterprise Edition also supports fine-grained permission management, access control of private and public networks, and image security scanning to ensure enterprise usersâ€™ data security and access compliance.

## Fast Distribution
TCR instances adopt a container-based deployment mode. With this mode, you can dynamically expand service capabilities based on actual situations to cope with spikes in business traffic. In combination with the self-developed P2P accelerated distribution plug-in, TCR instances support concurrent pulling of GB-level images by thousands of nodes.

## Support for Helm Charts
TCR supports the hosting and distribution of both container images and Helm charts. It is compatible with Helm V3, allows Kubernetes users to use Helm charts and container images simultaneously, and provides a consistent user experience.


## Container DevOps
TCR is seamlessly integrated with TKE and CODING DevOps, supporting centralized configuration of image building, image scanning and distribution, and container application deployment. It can also implement automatic triggering of container application beta updates by code updates and improve application delivery efficiency.
