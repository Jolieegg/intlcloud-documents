Tencent Container Registry (TCR) supports network access control for TCR Enterprise instances. To ensure data security of your image repositories and Helm Charts, the public and private network access entries are disabled for the newly created TCR Enterprise instances by default. This means that all external access requests are denied.

Based on your application requirements, you can configure public and private network access control policies to minimize the application clients that can access the instance and pull/push images. For more information, please see:
