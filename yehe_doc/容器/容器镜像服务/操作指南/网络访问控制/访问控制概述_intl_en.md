Tencent Container Registry (TCR) supports network access control for Enterprise Edition instances. To ensure data security of your image repositories and Helm charts, the public and private network access entries are disabled for Enterprise Edition instances by default. This means that all external access requests are denied.

Based on your business requirements, you can configure public and private network access control policies to minimize the business clients that can access the instance. For more information, please see:
