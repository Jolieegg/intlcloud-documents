## 3. Getting Started

#### 3.1 Registration and authentication

Before using TCR, you need to sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/account/register) and complete the [identity verification](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/378/3629).

#### 3.2 Role authorization

You need to authorize the current service role and grant the TCR operation permissions before accessing other Tencent Cloud service resources.
Log in to the Tencent Cloud console, select **Products** > **Tencent Container Registry** to enter the [TCR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcr/instance?rid=1), grant permissions for your role to perform operations on relevant resources, and then you can create an TCR Enterprise instance.

#### 3.3 Purchasing a TCR Enterprise instance

You can go to [TCR Purchase Page](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/tcr?rid=1) to select the region and specifications of the instance as needed. For more information, see [Purchasing Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1051/35486).

#### 3.4 Configuring a TCR Enterprise Edition instance

After purchasing an Enterprise Edition instance, you can view your instance in TCR console, and configure the network access policy for it, implementing the push and pull of the container image.
- For how to use the Enterprise Edition instance to push and pull the image, please see [Quick Start](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1051/35484).
