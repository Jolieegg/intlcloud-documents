Dataway is a scripting engine for custom flow execution data conversion and processing in iPaaS. It is integrated in iPaaS and plays a key role in implementing iPaaS extensibility.

iPaaS's many built-in components and connectors provide Dataway script-based customization capabilities to dynamically process connector events. For example:
- In the **Set Variable** component, you can use a Dataway script to dynamically set the variable value.
- In the **Transform** component, you can fully utilize the flexible syntax of Dataway for complex data processing and calculation to output the expected result, which can be further processed by downstream components.

You can directly use a Dataway expression in the built-in component configuration of iPaaS.
