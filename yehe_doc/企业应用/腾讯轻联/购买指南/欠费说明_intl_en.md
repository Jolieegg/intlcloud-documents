Once an Enterprise edition environment configuration expires, all integration apps published in the environment will stop automatically, and creation and running operations related to integration apps, API management, and security gateways will also be limited.

- Seven days before your environment configuration expires, the system will send you expiration alerts.
- If your account balance is sufficient and you enabled auto-renewal, the system will perform auto-renewal on the expiration date.
- If the service is not renewed before expiration, the system will stop all integration apps published in the environment.
