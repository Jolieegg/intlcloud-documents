## Environment Configuration Overview
iPaaS provides Trial edition and Enterprise edition environments. For more information on the environment configurations, see [Edition Details and Pricing](#method1).
- **Trial Edition**: Currently, iPaaS offers a 30-day free trial to new users, during which you can use all features and publish integration apps to the trial environment. After the **30-day period**, the trial environment will expire, integration apps running in the environment will stop automatically, and creation and running operations related to integration apps, API management, and security gateways will become limited. You cannot renew the trial environment. To continue using iPaaS after the trial period expires, you can purchase an Enterprise environment.
- **Enterprise Edition**: iPaaS offers four Enterprise edition environment configurations for integration scenarios of different scales. If none of the configurations meet your requirements, you can contact us on the purchase page to request a configuration.

>?Trial and Enterprise editions are both SaaS editions. iPaaS supports on-premises deployment and hybrid cloud deployment. If you have such needs, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
