## 1. Terms and Definitions

### 1.1 Tencent Integration Platform

Refers to the services provided by Tencent Cloud to connect applications, data, processes and services in local, private and public cloud environments. Tencent Integration Platform supports codeless and low-code integrated development, online debugging, rapid deployment, monitoring, alerting and other features. You can realize efficient integration of enterprise data, applications and processes, achieve efficient collaboration of enterprise business, supply chain and industrial chain, and support rapid innovation of enterprise business by using Tencent Integration Platform. The specific content of the Service is subject to the services purchased by you and provided by Tencent Cloud.

### 1.2 Service Month(s)

Service Month(s) refers to the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months until June 16 (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

### 1.3 Service Unavailability

If all access via the console page or API fails or all published integration flows cannot be scheduled for execution in a certain minute, the Service would be deemed as unavailable (“**Service Unavailability**”) in such minute, such minute would be counted as Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within such Service Month (as defined below), except under the circumstances as set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement. If the requests fail due to request flow restriction, identity authentication failure, service suspension for failure to pay, hack attack and other reasons in a certain minute, the Service would not be deemed as unavailable in such minute. The sum of minutes in which the Service is unavailable would be Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within such Service Month. 

### 1.4 Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within Service Month(s)

Service Downtime refers to the time period from the start of the Service Unavailability to the time the services are back to normal.

Service Downtime = the time when Service Unavailability is fixed - the time when Service Unavailability starts. If the Service is back to normal within 1 minute, i.e., the duration of the Service Unavailability lasts for less than 1 minute, such duration would not be counted as Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes. Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes shall be calculated by minutes, and Service Downtime less than 60 seconds shall be counted as 1 minute. For example, if Service Downtime is 1 minute and 1 second, Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes would be calculated as 2 minutes. The sum of Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes in a Service Month would be Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within such Service Month.

### 1.5 Total Number of Minutes within Service Month(s)

Total Number of Minutes within Service Month(s) = the total number of days in such Service Month(s) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

### 1.6 Monthly Service Fee

Refers to the service fees you actually consume within a Service Month, excluding the portion that has been purchased but not consumed yet.

## 2. Service Availability

### 2.1 Calculation of Service Availability

Service Availability = 1 - (Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within a Service Month / Total Number of Minutes within such Service Month) × 100%.

For example, if the Service is unavailable from 23:00 to 23:05 on a day in April 2021, Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within April would be 5 minutes, Service Availability in April 2021 would be 99.98% (= 1 - 5 / (30 × 24 × 60) × 100%).

### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

**The Service Availability for the Service shall be no less than 99.9%** (“**Service Availability Standard**”). If the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard (except under circumstances as set forth in the Disclaimer of Liabilities), you may claim compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.

## 3. Compensation Plan

In respect of the Service purchased by you, if the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms upon mutual agreement of both parties:

### 3.1 Standards of Compensation

(1) Compensations will be made in the form of voucher by Tencent Cloud, and after receiving the voucher, you should use the voucher by abiding the voucher usage rules (including usage period, etc., subject to the voucher usage rules published on Tencent Cloud official website). Such voucher cannot be converted into cash, and no invoice will be issued with respect thereof. The voucher may only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account, and you cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard in any Service Month, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month independently, and the aggregate amount shall be no more than the Monthly Service Fee you pay for the Service in the Service Month in which the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard (the Monthly Service Fee excludes the portion deducted by vouchers, coupons, service fee reduction or exemption, etc.).

| Service Availability in a Service Month     | Value of Compensational Voucher                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Less than 99.9% but is or higher than 99.5% | **5% of the Monthly Service Fee** |
| Less than 99.5% but is or higher than 97%   | **10% of the Monthly Service Fee**                     |
| Less than 97% but is or higher than 95%     | **20% of the Monthly Service Fee**                     |
| Less than 95%                               | **50% of the Monthly Service Fee**                     |

### 3.2 Time Limit for Compensation Application

(1) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you may **apply for compensation only through the Tencent Cloud ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5th) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud shall prevail.**

(2) **You shall apply for compensation no later than the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following the end of the Service Month in which the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard.** If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.

## 4. Disclaimer of Liabilities

**If the Service Unavailability occurs due to any of the following reasons, the corresponding Service Downtime shall not be counted towards Service Unavailability period, and is not eligible for compensation by Tencent Cloud, and Tencent Cloud will not be held liable to you:**

You may review the most updated version of relevant Agreement terms on the Tencent Cloud official website. If you disagree with such revisions made by Tencent Cloud to this Agreement, you have the right to cease using the Service; by continuing to use the Service, you shall be deemed to have accepted this Agreement as amended.
