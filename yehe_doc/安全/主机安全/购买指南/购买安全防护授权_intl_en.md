## Important Notes
Protection licenses are available to all Tencent Cloud users.


## Purchase Method
Protection licenses can be purchased through the [CWPP purchase page](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing). You can select the server to be bound when purchasing a license, or bind a server later after purchasing a license.


## Overdraft and Renewal
If auto-renewal has been set, but the deduction is unsuccessful because the relevant account has an insufficient balance or is overdrawn (balance below 0), the original license will be automatically unbound from the server (which means the protection will be stopped) and will enter a 30-day isolation period. If the license is not renewed during this period, the license order will be expired and terminated.

>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resources when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the partner.

## Refund
Refund amount = Actually paid amount - Price on the official website × Number of licenses/Purchased duration × Protection duration
If the refund amount is less than or equal to 0, it will be calculated as 0, and the license order will be terminated.
