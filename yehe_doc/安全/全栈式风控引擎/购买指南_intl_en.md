## Billing Overview

RCE is pay-as-you-go and settled monthly with tiered pricing.

### Pay-as-You-Go tiered pricing

>! The pay-as-you-go bill of each month will be settled on the first day of the following calendar month. If your account balance is insufficient for the payment, your service will be suspended.

| Tier (Calls) | USD/Call |
| :------------- | :------ |
| (0,1 million] | 0.021 |
| (1 million,2.5 million] | 0.017 |
| (2.5 million,5 million] | 0.01 |
| (5 million,10 million] | 0.006 |
| >10 million | 0.004 |

### Billing example

Let’s suppose that your call volume in January is 2 million calls, then as shown in the pay-as-you-go tiered pricing table, some of the calls fall into the tier of (0,1 million], and some into (1 million,2.5 million], and the fees will be calculated at the cumulative tiered prices, i.e., 0.021 * 1000000 + 0.017 * 1000000 = 38000 USD. The pay-as-you-go bill for January will be generated at 0:00 on February 1, and the fees will be directly deducted from your account balance.
