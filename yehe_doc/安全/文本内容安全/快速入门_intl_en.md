## Step 1. Sign up

Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account as instructed in [Signing up for a Tencent Cloud Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985).

>?  You can skip this step if you already have a Tencent Cloud account.

## Step 2. Create a sub-account (optional)

The account created when you [sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) is the root account, which has the management permissions of all resources under it. If you need your team members to assist you in managing resources under your account, you can use the CAM feature to create one or more sub-accounts, bind permission policies to them, and then assign them to team members. For detailed directions, see [Creating Sub-user](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/13674).

A newly created sub-account has no permissions by default and requires the root account or admin to bind a policy to it before it can have the operation permissions of certain resources. You can configure access to TMS with CAM for sub-accounts as instructed in [CAM Authorization Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1122/43795).
