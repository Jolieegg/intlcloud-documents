>!If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

## Overdue payment alert

Fees are deducted within 24 hours after a test is performed successfully. When your account balance becomes negative, we will notify your Tencent Cloud root account and all the subaccounts via email, SMS, and Message Center.

## Processing for overdue payments

CAT adopts the postpaid mode, with a deduction cycle of 24 hours. If your account balance is insufficient:

**When your account balance becomes negative:**

- Within two hours, the service is still available, fees are deducted, and all tasks enter the **Overdue** status.
- Two hours later, all test tasks stop and enter the **Suspended** status.

**Manually start a task as needed if your account is topped up to a positive balance.**
