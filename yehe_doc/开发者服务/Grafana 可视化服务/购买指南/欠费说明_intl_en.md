>!If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

## Alerting
- From seven days before your resource expires until the resource is released, the system will send alerts to your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators via email, SMS, and other methods as configured in the message subscription in the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message).
- For more information on the message notification mechanism, see [Prepaid Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/42701).


## Repossession
- Seven days before the expiration of your TCMG instance, the system will send you a renewal notification. 
- You can continue using the instance for an additional seven days after the expiration. The system will send you an expiration reminder, and you need to renew it as soon as possible.
- From the eighth day after expiration, you will not be able to use your instance, which will be suspended, but you can renew it.
- If you do not renew the instance **seven days after it becomes suspended**, it will be repossessed, and related data will be cleared and cannot be recovered. 
- In other words, the instance will remain **available for seven days** after the expiration and become **unavailable for another seven days**. You can renew it within the 14 days. If your account balance is sufficient and auto-renewal is enabled, the instance will be automatically renewed upon expiration.
