- Within 7 days after your account has overdue payments for 24 hours, your RUM service will be suspended, but you can still view the reported application data in the console, and the service will be automatically resumed after your account balance becomes positive.

### Termination mechanism 
If your account has overdue payments for more than 7 days, your business system in RUM will be automatically terminated, and the data cannot be recovered.
