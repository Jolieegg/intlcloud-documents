## System Image

### Image overview

A system image contains only the initial operating system (such as Linux or Windows Server) without applications or relevant runtime environment and configuration information; for example, images on different distributions of operating systems such as CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, and Windows Server.

### Use cases

It is suitable for users familiar with the installation and environment configuration of server operating systems and software programs. Lighthouse instances created from a system image have only the initial operating system environment installed, where you can install software programs or application systems as needed.

## Application Image
### Image overview
In addition to the underlying operating system, an application image also encapsulates applications, their runtime environments, and relevant initialization configuration information, such as LAMP, WordPress, ASP.NET, Node.js, and BT-Panel.

### Use cases

It is suitable for quick out-of-the-box application deployment. After a Lighthouse instance is created from an application image, the application system can be initialized automatically, and you can build the application in just a few steps of simple configuration, with no need to perform operations such as manually installing applications and uploading software packages.
