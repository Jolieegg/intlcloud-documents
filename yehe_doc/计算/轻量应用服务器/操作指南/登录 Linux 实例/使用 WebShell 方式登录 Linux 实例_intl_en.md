## Overview
OrcaTerm is a login method recommended by Tencent Cloud. You can use it to directly log in to a Linux instance quickly. It has the following strengths:
- Supports copy and paste.
- Supports scrolling with mouse wheel.



<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- When you create a Linux Lighthouse instance, it will be bound to a key by default. The username of the key is `lighthouse`, which has the root privileges.
- When you use OrcaTerm to log in to a Linux instance, the system will use the key of the `lighthouse` username for login by default.
</dx-alert>



## Supported Systems
Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Prerequisites

- Before login, confirm that the firewall of the instance has passed port 22 (which has been enabled by default when the instance was created).
