## Overview
VNC login allows for remote login of Lighthouse instances by using a web browser. If the remote login client is not available and all the other login methods failed, you can log in to an instance via VNC to check the instance status and perform basic management operations.

## Usage Limits
- VNC does not support copy and paste, and file upload or download.
- Use a mainstream browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, and IE 10 or later.
- Only one user can log in to an instance by using VNC at a time.

## Prerequisites
You must have the admin account and password for logging in to a Linux instance remotely.
