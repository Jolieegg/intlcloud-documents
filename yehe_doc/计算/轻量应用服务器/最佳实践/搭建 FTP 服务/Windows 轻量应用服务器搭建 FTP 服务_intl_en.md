## Overview
This document describes how to use IIS to build an FTP site on a Windows Lighthouse instance.

## Software
The following software programs are used to build the FTP service:

### Step 4. Set the shared folder permission

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
This document uses the `C:\test` folder as the shared folder of the FTP site. The folder contains the `test.txt` file you want to share with others. Create the `C:\test` folder and the `test.txt` file under it as instructed. You can also use any other folder as needed.

1. On the desktop, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/863967bab67b6cd83ce5f0924e1b19c8.png" style="margin:-3px 0px"> to open the **This PC** window.
2. Select and right-click the `test` folder under the C drive. Select **Properties**.
3. In the **test Properties** window, select the **Security** tab.
4. Select `Everyone` and click **Edit**.
If **Group or user names** does not contain `Everyone`, see [Adding `Everyone` user](#add) to add the user.

6. Click **OK** to complete the configuration.


### Step 5. Add an FTP site
1. In the **Server Manager** window, select **Tools** > **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** on the top-right navigation bar.
2. In the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** pop-up window, expand your server in the left sidebar, right-click **Sites**, and select **Add FTP Site**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/37c37446d72ad332aed4f3fb7f729ded.png)

   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/66623044cec7b4b318a7704601be708d.png)
    - **FTP site name**: Name of your FTP site. This document uses `ftp` as an example.
    - **Physical path**: Path of the shared folder with permissions configured. This document uses `C:\test` as an example.
4. On the **Binding and SSL Settings** page, enter the following information and click **Next**.
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/02682dc26ba3fdd74904e59baa498e97.png) 
   Configure the main parameters as follows:
     - **Binding**: The **IP Address** defaults to **All Unassigned**. The default FTP port number is 21. You can set a custom port number.
     - **SSL**: Select an option. In this document, **No SSL** is selected.
       -  **No SSL**: No SSL is used.
       - **Allow SSL**: Allow the FTP server to connect with clients with or without SSL.
      - **Require SSL**: SSL encryption is required for communication between the FTP server and clients.
   If you select **Allow SSL** or **Require SSL**, you can select an existing SSL certificate in **SSL Certificates** or [create an SSL certificate](#ssl).
5. On the **Authentication and Authorization Information** page, enter the following information and click **Next** as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/3187833727a8a8e58f589ddb00c789f1.png)
 - **Authentication**: Select an identity verification method. This document uses **Basic** as an example.
    - **Anonymous**: Allow users that provide the anonymous or FTP username to access the content.
	 - **Basic**: Require users to provide valid user names and passwords to access the content. Under this mode, passwords are transmitted without encryption. Therefore, select this authentication mode only when you know that the connection between the clients and the FTP server is secure (for example, by using SSL).
 - **Authorization**: Select one of the following options from the **Allow access to** drop-down list. This document uses the specified `ftpuser` user as an example.
	    - **All users**: All users, anonymous or identified, can access the content.
	        - **Anonymous users**: Anonymous users can access the content.
	        - **Specified role or user group**: Only the specified roles or members of the specified groups can access the content. If you choose this option, you need to specify the roles or user groups.
	        - **Specified users**: Only the specified user can access the content. If you choose this option, you need to specify the username.
 - **Permissions**: Set permissions as needed. This document selects both **Read** and **Write** permissions.
    - **Read**: Allow the authorized user to read the shared content.
    - **Write**: Allow the authorized user to write into the directory.
7. Click **Finish** to successfully create the FTP site.

### Step 6. Configure the security group and firewall
1. After the FTP site is created, add an inbound rule that allows traffic to the FTP port based on the FTP access mode:
 - **Active mode**: Open ports 20 and 21.
 - **Passive mode**: Open the ports 21 and 1024â€“65535.
For more information on how to open ports, see [Adding firewall rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1103/41393#.E6.B7.BB.E5.8A.A0.E9.98.B2.E7.81.AB.E5.A2.99.E8.A7.84.E5.88.99).
2. (Optional) See Microsoft documentation to configure firewall for the FTP site, so that the FTP server can accept passive connections from the firewall.

### Step 7. Test the FTP site
You can use tools such as the FTP client software, browser, or file manager to verify the FTP server. This document uses the file manager of the client as an example.
1. Configure Internet Explorer as needed:
 - Firewall has been configured (active mode):
 Open Internet Explorer on the **Client**, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**, deselect **Use Passive FTP (for firewall and DSL model compatibility)**, and click **OK**.
 - Firewall has not been configured (passive mode):
    1. Open Internet Explorer on the **FTP Server**, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**, deselect **Use Passive FTP (for firewall and DSL model compatibility)**, and click **OK**.
    2. Open Internet Explorer on the **Client**, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**, select **Use Passive FTP (for firewall and DSL model compatibility)**, and click **OK**.
2. Open the computer where the client is installed and enter the following path in the search box:
```
ftp://Lighthouse instance public IP:21
```
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/82387088e689998764a2dc6b78d13543.png)
3. In the pop-up window, enter the username and password configured in [creating the FTP username and password](#user).
4. You can upload and download files after a successful login.
