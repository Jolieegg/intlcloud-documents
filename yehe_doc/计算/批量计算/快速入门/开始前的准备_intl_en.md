## Step1： Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account
If you don't have a Tencent Cloud account yet, please log in to [Tencent Cloud official website](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/) and click **Sign up** in the top-right corner to register a Tencent Cloud account. For more information, please see [How to Sign up for Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985).
## Step2： Get SecretId and SecretKey
After BatchCompute is activated, if you want to use TencentCloud API, SDK, and CLI to manipulate its APIs, you will need the `SecretId` and `SecretKey`. Please create or view them in the [API Key Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/capi).
## Step3： Understand basic concepts
To better use the product, you should understand some [concepts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/599/10396) used in the product. You can also get product information and documentation on the [product introduction page](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/batch).
## Step4： Understand COS
As the standard output and remote storage mapping of BatchCompute are related to [COS](
https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6222), you should have a basic understanding of COS.
