>? Cloud GPU Service allows you to purchase, manage, and maintain GPU instances in the same way as CVM. For more information, see [CVM Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213).

**Note the following** before using GPU instances.
#### 1. Data Backup
Cloud GPU Service provides powerful computing capabilities. [GN8](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/560/19700) instances support local SSDs. Please back up data periodically to ensure data security and prevent data loss.
You can also purchase elastic cloud disks separately to further enhance data security and reliability.
#### 2. Renewal
You will receive an alert 7 days before the expiry date of GPU instances. Make sure your account balance is sufficient. GPU instances will be shut down, disconnected and moved to the recycle bin after the expiration.
#### 3. External Devices Mounting
You cannot mount external hardware devices (such as hardware dongle, USB flash drives, external disks, and U-keys) to a GPU instance.
#### 4. Configuration Adjustment
GPU instances cannot be upgraded or downgraded.
#### 5. Prohibition
  - Do not use GPU instances for **traffic traversal**. Tencent Cloud may suspend your service and repossess the resources if related behaviors are detected.
  - Do not use GPU instances to engage in **fraudulent online transactions** such as click farming (order, sales volume or advertisement) on e-commerce websites.
