## Non-linear Editing
Non-linear editing is a modern editing method used in film/TV post-production. To handle heavy graphic/image processing load, GPUs are required for image processing and visualization design. In addition, massive computing capacity, memory, and storage are needed to store and process media assets. With media assets stored in the cloud, a project can be shared in the network editing environment. Multiple users can work on the same project on their local machines at the same time, and perform separately tasks such as editing, subtitling, adding special effects, coloring, and packaging.

## Rendering
Rendering is the process of generating images from a model using software, and is widely used in fields such as video, simulation, and film/TV production. Rendering scenarios require GPUs for graphics acceleration and real-time rendering, and also require massive computing capacities, memory, and storage. High-performance computing and graphics rendering capabilities enable online graphics rendering, greatly shortening the production cycle and improving the overall efficiency.

## Remote Graphics Workstation
A remote graphics workstation adopts the client/server (C/S) architecture. A client equipped with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor connects to the server through a dedicated network for daily work. Generally, the server is centrally deployed in an information data center to handle graphics workload using GPUs.
