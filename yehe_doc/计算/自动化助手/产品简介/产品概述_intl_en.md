## What is TencentCloud Automation Tools?
TencentCloud Automation Tools (TAT) is a native Ops deployment tool for Tencent Cloud CVM and Lighthouse instances. TAT provides an automated approach for batch execution of commands (Shell, PowerShell, Python, etc.) for common daily tasks, such as running automated Ops scripts, polling processes, installing/uninstalling software, updating applications, and installing patches, without the need of instance login and password. 

### Batch execution
TAT enables you to remotely manage large-scale instances in a secure and reliable manner. TAT can execute Shell, PowerShell and Python commands in batches without using jump servers. You can use it for the automatic operation of common management tasks.

### Interactive session management
TAT provides a browser-based interactive Shell, which enables you to manage instances without the need to open inbound ports or manage SSH keys.

### Public command library
Tencent Cloud provides commands for common instance management and Ops tasks. You can also configure custom parameters as needed. For more requirements, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1147/46052).
