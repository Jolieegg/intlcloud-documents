## Billing

CBM is billed on a **pay-as-you-go** basis. For more information, see [Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180). In addition, [duration-based discounts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2176) are offered, which may differ from those for CVM and are subject to the information on the purchase page.


## Instance price
CBM instances have three billable items: network, storage (system disk and data disk), and computing (CPU, memory, and GPU). You can directly use the CVM [price calculator](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/price/cvm/calculator) to check out the combined price of all the products you need and estimate the resource costs. You can add the needed products to the cost estimate list and make the purchases swiftly.


## Renewal
* An instance will be shut down on the expiration day and automatically put and retained in the recycle bin for seven calendar days, during which you can renew it; otherwise, it will be terminated.
* You can set auto-renewal during purchase.

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
We recommend you renew your instance before expiration to avoid service interruption due to instance shutdown. For detailed directions, see [Renewing Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6143).

## Repossession

CBM instances are repossessed in the same manner as CVM instances. For more information, see CVM [Instance Repossession](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/213/4931?from_cn_redirect=1#.E5.AE.9E.E4.BE.8B.E5.9B.9E.E6.94.B6).

## Overdue payment
The overdue payment policy for CVM instances also applies to CBM instances. For more information, see CVM [Payment Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2181).

## Refund
The refund rules for CVM instances also apply to CBM instances.

## Notes

* The prices shown above are standard published prices. The actual prices are as indicated on the purchase page, as the prices may change due to price reductions or other factors.
* Certain new-gen pay-as-you-go CBM instances based on the elastic bare metal architecture will not be billed after shutdown. For more information, see [No Charges When Shut Down for Pay-as-You Go Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/19918).
