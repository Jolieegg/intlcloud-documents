You can save the code for purchasing CVM instances with the same configuration. For more information, see [Generating API Explorer Reusable Scripts to Create Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/39811).
4. Click **Buy Now** or **Activate** and make the payment.
After making the payment, you can log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) to check your CVM instance.
Information such as the instance name, public IP address, private IP address, login username, and initial login password of the CVM will be sent to your account through the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message). You can use this information to log in to and manage your instances. To ensure the security of your CVM, please change your CVM login password as soon as possible.

## Logging in to the Instance

After completing CVM operations, you can log in to your CVM on the Tencent Cloud console and perform operations such as building a site as needed.
Select a method for logging in to the CVM on the Tencent Cloud console as needed:
- [Logging in to Linux Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436)
