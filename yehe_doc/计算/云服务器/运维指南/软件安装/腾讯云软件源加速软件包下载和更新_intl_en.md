## Overview

To solve the problem of slow access to official sources when installing dependencies, Tencent Cloud has set up a cache service for some software. You can accelerate the installation of dependencies by using the Tencent Cloud software repository, which currently supports public network access and private network access.
- Public network access address: `http://mirrors.tencent.com`
- Private network access address: `http://mirrors.tencentyun.com/`

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- This document takes the public network access address of the Tencent Cloud software repository as an example to introduce how to use the software sources in the Tencent Cloud software repository in CVM. If you access the repository using a private network, please replace the public network access address **with the private network access address**.
- The source address used in this document is for reference only. Please obtain the latest address from the **Tencent Cloud software repository**.
</dx-alert>


## Notes

The Tencent Cloud software repository updates software sources from the official website of each software source once per day.

## Prerequisites

Log in to the CVM.

## Directions

### Accelerating pip using the Tencent Cloud image source


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
Before using the Tencent Cloud image source, please confirm your CVM has Python installed.
</dx-alert>


#### Use the software source path temporarily
Execute the following command to install pip using Tencent Could PyPI.
```shell
pip install pip -i  the directory where PyPI is located in
```
For example, if you want to install the 17monip package, and the PyPI you need to use is in the `http://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple` directory, run the following command:
```shell
pip install 17monip -i http://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple --trusted-host mirrors.tencent.com 
```

#### Set the default software source path
Execute the following command to modify the `index-url` parameter in the `~/.pip/pip.conf` file to the source path of the Tencent Cloud software repository.

```shell
[global]
index-url = the directory where PyPI is located in
trusted-host = public network/private network access address
```
For example, if the PyPI you need to use is in the `http://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple` directory, execute the following command:
```shell
[global]
index-url = http://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple
trusted-host = mirrors.tencent.com
```
