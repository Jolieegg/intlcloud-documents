## Overview
This document shows you how to configure a multi-user remote login to Windows CVM, taking a CVM with Windows Server 2016 R2 as the operating system as an example.

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
The trial period of the multi-user remote login feature provided by Microsoft is 120 days. If you haven't purchased multi-user login licenses (RDS CALs), after the trial ends, you can log in to CVM only through the `mstsc /admin` command but not Remote Desktop. Windows Server allows two users to log in at the same time by default, which meets most needs. Evaluate your needs based on your actual business scenarios, and if you strongly need to configure multi-user remote login, proceed as instructed in this document.
