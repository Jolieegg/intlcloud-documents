## Overview
This document describes how to perform initialization operations such as formatting, partitioning, and creating a file system on a Linux CVM data disk.

## Notes

- Before formatting, ensure that no data is stored on the data disk and that important data has been backed up. After formatting, all data on the data disk will be cleared.
- To prevent service exceptions, ensure that the CVM has stopped providing external services before formatting.

## Directions

Follow the appropriate operation guide based on the disk capacity.
- If the disk capacity is less than 2 TB, follow the instructions under [Initializing Cloud Disks (Linux)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31597).
- If the disk capacity is 2 TB or more, follow the instructions under [Initializing Cloud Disks (Linux)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31598).
