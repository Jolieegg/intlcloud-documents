### Can I purchase CVM instances with Windows Server 2003?

Microsoft discontinued extension support for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server R2 on July 14, 2015. Therefore Tencent Cloud is no longer able to provide CVM instances with Windows Server 2003.

### How do I select a storage type?

For data that requires high reliability, use [Cloud Block Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33000) instead of [local disks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5798?from_cn_redirect=1) for data storage.
For frequently-assessed data with fluctuating capacity, we recommend that you use Tencent Cloud's Cloud Databases.
