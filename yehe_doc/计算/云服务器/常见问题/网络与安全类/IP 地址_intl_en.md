### What are the differences between public gateways and CVMs with public IP addresses?

Public gateways enable the public network traffic forwarding feature in the image. However, CVMs with public IP addresses do not have the traffic forwarding feature by default. CVMs that use the Windows public image cannot function as public gateways because the traffic forwarding feature is disabled in the Windows image.
