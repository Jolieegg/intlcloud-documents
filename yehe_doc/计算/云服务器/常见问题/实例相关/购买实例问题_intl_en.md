### How do I purchase a CVM?

You can purchase both Tencent Cloud services and pay-as-you-go CVMs (billing is accurate to the seconds and settled on an hourly basis) on the Tencent Cloud Console. For more information, see [Billing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).

### What instance types does CVM provide?

CVM provides multiple instance specifications. For more information, see [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518). You can select the appropriate instance type based on your business needs.
- To manage sudden business surges, you can choose the pay-as-you-go billing method, which allows you to activate/terminate instances at any time and only pay for resources that you actually use. Billing is accurate to the seconds to maximize your savings. 

### Can I purchase a Windows 2003 CVM?

Because Microsoft discontinued support for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2 since July 14th, 2015, Tencent Cloud no longer provides the Windows 2003 server, which is not available for purchase.


### What are some channels through which I can purchase CVMs?

You can purchase CVMs either from the Console or via an API.

### When can I use the CVM I purchased?

After the CVM system installation is completed, you can log in to and use the CVM once its status becomes **running**.

### How do I check which instances are available for purchase in a specific region or availability zone?

You can go to the [CVM purchase page](http://manage.qcloud.com/shoppingcart/shop.php?tab=cvm&_ga=1.53600366.770173325.1571651505) to view the instance types available in each region or availability zone.

### What can I do if the resource of an instance I want to purchase is sold out?

If the resource of a specific instance you want to purchase is sold out, we recommend you:
- Select another region
- Select another availability zone
- Select another resource

If the resource that you want to purchase is still not available after you take all of the measures above, try again later. Instance resources are dynamic. When resources are insufficient, Tencent Cloud will replenish them as soon as possible.
