### How do I log in to a CVM instance using VNC?

Tencent Cloud allows users to log in to a CVM instance by using the VNC web client. If you do not have a remote login client installed or cannot log in using the client, you can use a VNC web client to log in to a CVM instance. You can use the web client to log in remotely, view the CVM instance status, and perform basic instance management. For detailed instructions, refer to the following documents:
- [Logging into Linux Instances via VNC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32494)
- [Logging into Windows Instances via VNC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32496)

### How do I enable multi-user remote login on a Windows server?

The Windows server supports multi-user remote login. For detailed configuration directions, refer to [Setting Up Multi-user Remote Login for Windows CVMs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32497).
If you fail to enable multi-user remote login on a Windows server after following the directions in the document above, restart the instance and try logging in again.
