### How can I obtain the initial CVM password?

- If you purchase the CVM through [Custom Configuration](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cvm?tab=custom), you can obtain the initial password based on different login methods as follows:
<table>
	<tr><th>Login Method</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Random Password</td><td>The initial password will be sent to you via email and <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message">Message Center</a> on the console.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SSH Key Pair</td><td><b>Disabled by default</b> you can log in to the CVM using your username and password, but the initial password will still be sent to you via email and <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message">Message Center</a> on the console.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Custom Password</td><td>The password you set is the initial password.</td></tr>
</table>

For more information, see [Managing Login Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17008).

### What should I do if I cannot receive the initial password via Message Center?

If you cannot find the password in Message Center, please confirm that you log in to the console with a root account. If not, switch to the root account and check again.
