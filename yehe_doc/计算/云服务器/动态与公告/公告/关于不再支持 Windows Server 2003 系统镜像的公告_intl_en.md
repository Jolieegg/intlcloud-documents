## Use Instructions

Microsoft has ended extended support for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2 since July 14, 2015. Tencent CVMs with the Windows 2003 system can no longer receive security updates and patches from Microsoft, and face risks such as program incompatibility, instability and insecurity.
To ensure the security and stability of your business, we recommend you migrate CVMs with the Windows Server 2003 system to a newer version of Windows Server, such as Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

1. After July 14, 2015, Tencent CVMs with the Windows Server 2003 system can no longer receive updates and patches from Microsoft. If you continue to use CVMs with this system, your applications and businesses may be exposed to a variety of risks, including but not limited to application incompatibility, compliance requirements, and security problems caused by non-functional issues.
2. If you continue to use CVMs with the Windows Server 2003 system after July 14, 2015, Tencent Cloud will not be held responsible for any failures, security issues, incompatibility or other risks due to lack of support from Microsoft. You will be liable for all the consequences arising therefrom.
