CentOS has officially discontinued support for CentOS 8 since January 1, 2022 (See [CentOS's official announcement](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/?spm=a2c4g.11174386.n2.3.348f4c07hk46v4)). 

## Notes
Tencent Cloud continues providing CentOS 8 images for now, but there are no more updates on CentOS 8 images and OS versions. You can migrate to the following images. 
- [TencentOS Server](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/213/40223): TencentOS Server benefits from the rich experience of Tencent in operating systems over the last decade. It’s now used as the OS of over 99% of Tencent’s internal servers. 
- [OpenCloudOS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/46209): The basic libraries and user-mode components of OpenCloudOS are fully compatible with CentOS 8. It is optimized and enhanced at the kernel level. It has been used on more than 10 million nodes. The result shows that its stability is 70% better than CentOS 8 and the performance is improved by 50% in specific scenarios. 
- CentOS Stream and other released versions such as Ubuntu
