Cloud Object Storage (COS) provided by Tencent Cloud is a distributed storage service designed to handle a massive amount of files. You can store all your files in one place and manage them using an easy-to-use interface at any time.

COS stores data redundantly across multiple regions and allows multiple clients or application threads to perform read/write operations on the data at the same time. The data on COS can be retrieved in a similar way to data on Internet domain names and be accessed by using an HTTP URL address.

For more information on COS, refer to [COS Product Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436).
