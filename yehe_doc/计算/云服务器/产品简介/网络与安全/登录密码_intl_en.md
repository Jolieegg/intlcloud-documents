The password is a unique login credential for the CVM instance. To ensure instance security, Tencent Cloud provides the following two encrypted login methods:
- Password login
- [SSH key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501) login
 
When creating the CVM, you can refer to the following documents to choose different encrypted login methods based on your CVM operating system.
- [Custom Configuration for Windows CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10516)
- [Custom Configuration for Linux CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10517)

Anyone with an instance login password can log into the CVM instance remotely through a public network address allowed by the security group. Therefore, we recommend you use a secure password and change it periodically.
For more password-related operations, please see [Manage Login Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17008).
