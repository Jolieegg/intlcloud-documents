Tencent Cloud allows users to purchase CVM instances either from the console or via API. This document describes these two purchase methods in detail.

## Purchasing an Instance at the Official Website

There are two types of CVM instances available: pay-as-you-go instance (billed by second and settled hourly) and spot instance (billed by second and settled hourly). For billing details, see [Billing Plans](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).
