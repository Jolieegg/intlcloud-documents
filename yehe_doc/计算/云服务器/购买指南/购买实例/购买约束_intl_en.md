## Purchase Limits

### Pay-as-you-go CVM instances[](id:PayAsYouGoLimit)
 The following features are not available to pay-as-you-go CVM instances:
 - Agents paying on your behalf
 - Monthly postpaid users
- The **purchase limit** of pay-as-you-go CVM instances for each user in each AZ is between 30 and 60. See the CVM purchase page for the exact purchase limit. If you need more instances, [apply for an instance purchase quota increase](#ApplyForQuota).



## Applying for Instance Purchase Quota Increase[](id:ApplyForQuota)
If you need more instances than your quota in a region, apply for an increase as instructed in [Increasing Instance Purchase Quota](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/46161), where you need to select the billing mode, target region, target quota, instance configuration, and application reason. We will evaluate your application based on your actual needs and increase your quota accordingly.

If you need to apply for an increase in different AZs, submit applications separately, as different AZs come with different quotas.
