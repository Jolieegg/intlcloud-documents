## Pay-as-you-go CVM Instances

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/463d6b815dcf2677ebe28f9683d14430.jpg)

### Notes
- After you stop using pay-as-you-go resources, **terminate them as soon as possible** to avoid fee deduction.
- After a CVM instance is terminated or repossessed, its data will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- Since your actual resource consumption changes constantly, some slight discrepancies may exist for the stated balance in the low balance alert.

### Alerts

<table>
	<tr><th>Alert Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Overdue payment reminder</b></td><td>Pay-as-you-go resources are billed on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators will be notified via email and SMS.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Overdue payment alert</b></td><td>This feature is disabled by default.</td></tr>

### Overdue payment policy
When your account balance falls below zero, you can continue to use CVM instances for the next 2 hours. We will also continue to bill you for this usage. After 2 hours, if your account balance remains negative, your CVM instances will be shut down automatically and the billing will stop.
After automatic shutdown, your CVM instances go through the following stages:
<table>
	<tr><th>Time Since Shutdown</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan=2><b>â‰¤ 15 days</b></td><td>If your account is topped up to a positive balance, the billing resumes and you can continue to use your CVM instances.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>If your account balance remains negative, you will not be able to start your CVM instances.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>> 15 days</b></td><td>If your account is not topped up to a positive balance, your pay-as-you-go CVMs will be repossessed. All data will be erased and cannot be recovered. When your CVM is repossessed, Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators will be notified via email and SMS.</td></tr>

## Bill-by-traffic Network
