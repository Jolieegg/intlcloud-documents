The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is intended to synchronize the clocks on all the computers in a network to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Tencent Cloud provides an intranet NTP server for Tencent Cloud intranet devices. For non-Tencent cloud devices, you can use the public network NTP server provided by Tencent Cloud.

### Intranet NTP Server

```ruby
time1.tencentyun.com
time2.tencentyun.com
time3.tencentyun.com
time4.tencentyun.com
time5.tencentyun.com
```

### Public Network NTP Server
```ruby
ntp.tencent.com
ntp1.tencent.com
ntp2.tencent.com
ntp3.tencent.com
ntp4.tencent.com
ntp5.tencent.com
```
The following are old public NTP server addresses. These old addresses can still be used, but you are advised to use the new ones.
```ruby
time.cloud.tencent.com
time1.cloud.tencent.com 
time2.cloud.tencent.com 
time3.cloud.tencent.com
time4.cloud.tencent.com
time5.cloud.tencent.com
```
