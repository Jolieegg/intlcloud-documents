## Scenario

The Windows Time service (W32Time) synchronizes the time between the local system and the clock source server. It uses NTP to synchronize computer clocks on the network. The following uses a CVM that runs Windows Server 2012 as an example to describe how to enable the NTP service and modify the IP address of the clock source server.

## Directions

1. Log in to the Windows CVM.
2. On the desktop, choose <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87d894e564b7e837d9f478298cf2e292.png" style="margin: 0;"></img> > **Task Manager** > **Services** to open the **Services** window.
