The new-generation Tencent Cloud CVM instances (including SA3, S6, C6, etc.) come with ultra-high network performance as detailed in [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518). This document provides two high-throughput network performance test methods for CVM instances: netperf and DPDK.

The netperf test is recommended for most use cases. However, if the CVMâ€™s network throughput is larger than 10 million pps and the network bandwidth is higher than 50 Gbps, the kernel protocol stack of netperf consumes a lot of network resources. To obtain the actual network performance of the CVM ENI, use the DPDK method to shield the difference caused by the kernel protocol stack.
