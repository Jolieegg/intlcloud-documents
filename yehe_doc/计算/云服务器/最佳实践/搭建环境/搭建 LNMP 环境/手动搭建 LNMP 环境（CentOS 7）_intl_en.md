## Overview
The LNMP environment is a website server architecture consisting of Nginx, MySQL or MariaDB, and PHP running on Linux. This document describes how to manually set up the LNMP environment on a Tencent Cloud CVM.

To manually set up the LNMP environment, you should familiarize yourself with common Linux commands such as [installing software via YUM in CentOS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2046), and understand the usage and version compatibility of the software to be installed.
>! Itâ€™s recommended that you can configure the LNMP environment through the image environment of Tencent Cloud marketplace, and it may take a long time to set up the LNMP environment manually.

## Software
The following software is used to build the LNMP environment.
- Linux: Linux operating system. This document uses CentOS 7.6 as an example.
- Nginx: web server. This document uses Nginx 1.17.7 as an example.
- MariaDB: database. This document uses MariaDB 10.4.8 as an example.
- PHP: scripting language. This document uses PHP 7.2.22 as an example.


## Prerequisite
Setting up a LNMP environment requires a Linux CVM. If you have not purchased one yet, see [Getting Started with Linux CVMs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/213/10517).


## Directions

### Step 1: log in to a Linux instance
[Log in to the Linux instance using standard login method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). You can also use any of the following login methods you are comfortable with:
- [Logging in to Linux Instances via Remote Login Tools](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502)
- [Logging into Linux Instance via SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501)

### Step 2: install Nginx
1. Run the following command to create a file named `nginx.repo` under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.
```
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo
```
2. Press **i** to switch to the editing mode and enter the following.
```
[nginx] 
name = nginx repo 
baseurl = https://nginx.org/packages/mainline/centos/7/$basearch/ 
gpgcheck = 0 
enabled = 1
```
3. Click **Esc** and enter **:wq** to save and close the file.
4. Run the following command to install Nginx.
```
yum install -y nginx
```
5. Run the following command to open the `default.conf` file.
```
vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```
6. Press **i** to switch to the edit mode to modify the `default.conf` file.
7. Find `server{...}` and replace the content inside the curly brackets with the following. This is to cancel the listening of the IPv6 address and configure Nginx to realize linkage with PHP.
```
server {
	listen       80;
	root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
	server_name  localhost;
	#charset koi8-r;
	#access_log  /var/log/nginx/log/host.access.log  main;
	#
	location / {
		  index index.php index.html index.htm;
	}
	#error_page  404              /404.html;
	#redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
	#
	error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
	location = /50x.html {
	  root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
	}
	#pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
	#
	location ~ .php$ {
	  fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
	  fastcgi_index  index.php;
	  fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
	  include        fastcgi_params;
	}
}
```
7. Press **Esc** and enter **:wq** to save and close the file.
8. Run the following command to start Nginx.
```
systemctl start nginx
```
9. Run the following command to enable Nginx autostart.
```
systemctl enable nginx 
```
10. Enter the following URL in your local browser and verify whether the Nginx service is working properly.
```
http://[Public IP address of the CVM instance]
```
If the following appears, Nginx has been successfully installed and configured.

### Step 3: install a database
1. Run the following command to check if MariaDB is already installed. 
```
rpm -qa | grep -i mariadb
```
 - If the following appears, MariaDB is already installed.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/6fa7fb51de4a61f4da08eb036b6c3e85.png)
To avoid conflicts between different versions, run the following command to remove the installed MariaDB.
```
yum -y remove [Package name]
```
 - If nothing is returned, MySQL has not been installed. In this case, proceed to the next step.
2. Execute the following command to create the `MariaDB.repo` file under `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.
```
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/MariaDB.repo
```
3. Press **i** to switch to edit mode and enter the following content to add MariaDB.
>? 
>- Different operating systems require different versions of MariaDB. Download [MariaDB](https://downloads.mariadb.org) that is compatible with your operating system.
>- If your CVM has [private network access](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225), change `mirrors.cloud.tencent.com` to the private network address `mirrors.tencentyun.com`. In this way, your public network traffic will not be affected and the access is faster.
