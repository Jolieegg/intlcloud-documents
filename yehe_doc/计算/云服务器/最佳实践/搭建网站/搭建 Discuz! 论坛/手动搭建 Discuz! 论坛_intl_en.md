## Overview

Used by over 2 million websites, Discuz! is the worldâ€™s most sophisticated and predominant forum software. This document describes how to set up a forum website using Discuz! on Tencent Cloud CVM instance and deploy the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) runtime environment it needs.


To manually set up a Discuz! website, you should be familiar with common Linux commands (see [Installing Software via YUM under CentOS Environment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2046)), and understand the usage and version compatibility of the software to be installed.





## Software
The following software versions are used to build a Discuz! website.
- Linux: Linux operating system. This document uses CentOS 7.6 as an example.
- Apache: Web server software. This document uses Apache 2.4.15 as an example.
- MariaDB: database. This document uses MariaDB 5.5.60 as an example.
- PHP: scripting language. This document uses PHP 5.4.16 as an example.
- Discuz!: forum software. This document uses Discuz! X3.4 as an example.


## Directions
### Step 1: log in to the CVM
[Log in to the Linux instance using standard login method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). You can also use any of the following login methods you are comfortable with:
