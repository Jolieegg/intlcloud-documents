## 1. Terms and Definitions

#### 1.1 Tencent Cloud Public IP Service
Refers to the public IP services, related technologies and network support services as provided on Tencent Cloud website at `www.tencentcloud.com`.

#### 1.2 Service Month(s)
Refers to the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

#### 1.3 Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month

Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month = the total number of days of the Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

#### 1.4 Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes

If all the data packets in the outbound direction of the public IP instance are discarded at the Tencent Cloud breakout gateway device within a certain minute, the Service of the public IP instance is deemed to be unavailable within such minute. The sum of the minutes that the Service of the public IP instance is unavailable within a Service Month shall be the Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes.

#### 1.5 Monthly Service Fee
Refers to the total service fee you pay for a single public IP instance in a Service Month. If you pay for several Service Months at once, the Monthly Service Fee will be apportioned based on the number of Service Months purchased.

## 2. Service Availability

#### 2.1 Calculation of Service Availability

Service Availability for a single IP instance shall be counted and calculated on the basis of Service Months, as follows:
Service Availability = (Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month - Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes) / Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month × 100%

#### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

**The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud shall be no less than 99.95%** (“Service Availability Standard”). If the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard (except under circumstances as set forth in the Disclaimer of Liabilities), you may claim compensation in accordance with Article 3 of this Agreement. Assuming a month consists of 30 days, the time of a single instance to meet the Service Availability Standard in such Service Month shall be no less than 43178.4 minutes (= 30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes × 99.95%), i.e., Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes shall be no more than 21.6 minutes (= 43200 minutes - 43178.4 minutes).

## 3. Compensation Plan

In respect of the Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

#### 3.1 Standards of Compensation

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and you should use the voucher by abiding the voucher usage rules (including usage period, etc., subject to the voucher usage rules published on Tencent Cloud official website). Such voucher cannot be converted into cash, and no invoice will be issued with respect thereof. The voucher may only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account, and you cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month separately, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such Service Month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by vouchers, coupons, service fee reduction or exemption, etc.).

Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud shall prevail**.

(2) **You shall apply for compensation no later than the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following the end of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the Service Availability Standard.** If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.
