## Overview
CVM accounts and passwords are the login credentials for CVMs. This document describes how to use and manage passwords when logging in to a CVM.

## Limits

The password must comply with the following limits:
- **Linux instance**: The password must consist of 8 to 30 characters. We recommend that you use a password of more than 12 characters. The password cannot start with "/" and must contain at least three of the following character types (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and special characters `<code> `()`~!@#$%^&*-+=_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/</code>`).
- **Windows instance**: The password must consist of 12 to 30 characters. The password cannot start with "/" and must contain at least three of the following character types (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and special characters `<code>()`~!@#$%^&*-+=_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/</code>`), excluding user names.

## Directions

For different configuration methods selected during CVM purchase, the initial password settings will also be different.
 - Instance creation through [**Custom configuration**](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/cvm?regionId=4&projectId=-1): During creation, the initial password setting methods for different login modes are different.
