## Overview
This document describes how to create a dedicated reservation in the CVM console. A dedicated reservation allows you to reserve resources to guarantee a sufficient supply of resources.

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Upon the creation of a dedicated reservation, the requested instances are reserved for you. Note that idle resources in the dedicated reservation will incur an idle fee. For details, see [Dedicated Reservation Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/43857).
