Currently, the **standard login method (WebRDP)** is used for Windows instances by default. It allows you to log in to a Windows instance in the console without downloading a local login client. For the login method, see [Logging in to Windows Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/41018).
</dx-alert>



## Overview
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a multiple-channel protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a local computer to connect to a remote computer. We recommend you use RDP to log in to your Windows CVMs. This document describes how to log in to Windows instances using RDP files.

## Supported Systems
You can log in to your CVMs from Windows, Linux, and MacOS using RDP.

## Prerequisites

- You must have the admin account and password for logging in to a Windows instance remotely.
  - If you have chosen to generate a random password when creating an instance, please get it from [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message).
  - If you have set a login password, please use it for login. If you forgot it, please [reset it](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
- You have purchased a public IP for your CVM instance and opened a remote login port (3389 by default) for the WebRDP proxy IP in the security group associated with the instance.
  - If you purchase a CVM instance through quick configuration, the port is opened by default.
  - If you purchase a CVM instance through custom configuration, you can manually open the port as instructed in [Security Group Use Cases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32369).
- Make sure that the public network bandwidth of your instance is ≥ 5 Mbit/s; otherwise, the remote desktop may lag. To adjust the network bandwidth, please see [Adjusting Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/15517).


## Directions
<dx-tabs>
::: Logging in to your Windows CVM using RDP[](id:windowsRDP)

2. On the instance management page, proceed according to the actually used view mode:
 - **List mode**: locate the Windows CVM instance you want to log in to and click **Log In** on the right as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/bad0e4e6670096461c7e9498d5d47654.png)
 - **Tab mode**: select the tab of the Windows CVM instance you want to log in to and click **Log In** as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/2cdbf7a52ed228109fd1bc55a6ed1d6c.png)
3. In the **Standard Login | Windows Instance** window that is opened, select **Download RDP File**.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
If you have changed the remote login port, append the IP address with `:port` in the RDP file.
</dx-alert>
<img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0b0076390b95da3885c8967093683975.png"/>
4. Double-Click the downloaded RDP file, enter the password, and click **OK** to remotely connect to your Windows CVM.
  - If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, you can obtain the password at the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message).
  - If you forgot your password, please [reset the instance password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).

::: Logging in to your Linux CVM using RDP[](id:LinuxRDP)


<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
We recommend you use rdesktop as the remote desktop client. For more information, see the [official introduction to rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/).
</dx-alert>


1. Run the following command to check whether rdesktop has been installed.
```
rdesktop
```
   - If yes, perform [step 4](#step04).
   - If no, you will be prompted with "command not found". In this case, perform [step 2](#step02).
2. [](id:step02)Open a terminal window and run the following command to download rdesktop. This step uses rdesktop v1.8.3 as an example.
```
wget https://github.com/rdesktop/rdesktop/releases/download/v1.8.3/rdesktop-1.8.3.tar.gz
```
If you want to install the latest version, visit [the rdesktop page on GitHub](https://github.com/rdesktop/rdesktop/releases) to find it. Then replace the path in the command with that of the latest version.
3. In the directory where rdesktop will be installed, run the following commands to decompress and install rdesktop.
```
tar xvzf rdesktop-<x.x.x>.tar.gz ## Replace x.x.x with the version number of the downloaded rdesktop. 
cd rdesktop-1.8.3
./configure 
make 
make install
```
4. [](id:step04)Run the following command to connect to the remote Windows instance.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Replace the parameters in the example with your own parameters.
</dx-alert>
```
rdesktop -u Administrator -p <your-password> <hostname or IP address>
```
   - `Administrator` refers to the admin account mentioned in the prerequisites section.
   - `<your-password>` refers to the login password that you set.
      If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, you can obtain the password at the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message). If you forgot your password, please [reset the instance password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
   - `<hostname or IP address>` is the public IP or custom domain name of your Windows instance. For more information on how to get the public IP, please see [Getting Public IP Addresses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17940).

::: Logging into you MacOS CVM using RDP[](id:MacRDP)


<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- The following operations use Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac as an example. Microsoft stopped providing a link to download the Remote Desktop client in 2017. Currently, its subsidiary HockeyApp is responsible for releasing the beta client. Go to [Microsoft Remote Desktop Beta](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/rdmacios-k2vy/apps/microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac/distribution_groups/all-users-of-microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac) to download a Beta version.

## RDP Bandwidth Limit Description[](id:illustrate)
The available network bandwidth directly affects the experience of logging in to and using CVM instances over RDP, and different applications and display resolutions require different network configurations. Microsoft has laid down the minimum bandwidth requirements for instances when using RDP in different application scenarios. Please check out the following table to make sure that the network configuration of your instance can meet your business needs; otherwise, issues such as lag may occur.


<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
To adjust the bandwidth of your instance, please see [Adjusting Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/15517).
