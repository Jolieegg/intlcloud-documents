## Overview
This document describes how to log in to a Windows instance from different mobile devices using Microsoft Remote Desktop.

## Applicable Mobile Devices
iOS and Android devices

## Prerequisites
- The CVM instance is in the **Running** status.
- You already have the administrator account and password to log in to the instance.
 - If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, go to [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message) to obtain the password first.
 - If youâ€™ve forgotten your password, you can [reset the instance password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
