## Overview
This document describes how to log in to a Windows instance using the standard login method (WebRDP). 

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
This method does not vary by the local operating system and supports direct login to the Windows instance in the console.
</dx-alert>



## Prerequisites[](id:Prerequisites)
- You must have the admin account and password for logging in to a Windows instance remotely.
 - If you have set a login password, please use it for login. If you forgot it, please [reset it](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
 - If you have chosen to generate a random password when creating an instance, please get it from [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message).
- You have purchased a public IP for your CVM instance and opened a remote login port (3389 by default) for the WebRDP proxy IP in the security group associated with the instance.
 - If you purchase a CVM instance through quick configuration, the port is opened by default.
 - If you purchase a CVM instance through custom configuration, you can manually open the port as instructed in [Security Group Use Cases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32369).
- Make sure that the public network bandwidth of your instance is â‰¥ 5 Mbit/s; otherwise, the remote desktop may lag. To adjust the network bandwidth, please see [Adjusting Network Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/15517).
