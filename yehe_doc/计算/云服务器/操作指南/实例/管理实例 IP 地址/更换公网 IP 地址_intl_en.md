## Overview

This document describes how to change the public IP address of a CVM instance.

## Considerations
- Each account can change the public IPs of CVMs in the same region a maximum of 3 times per day.
- The public IP of each instance can be changed **once only**.
- **The old public IP will be released after the change.**

## Prerequisites

You have logged in to [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).

## Directions
On the instance management page, proceed according to the actually used view mode:
