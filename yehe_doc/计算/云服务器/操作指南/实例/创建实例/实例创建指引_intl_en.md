This document introduces several methods of creating CVM instances, from basic operations to advanced custom features.
- Creating CVM instances via the CVM purchase page is the most commonly used method. It allows you to flexibly select the configurations that meet your business requirements. For more information, see [Creating Instances via CVM Purchase Page](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4855).
- If you want to use a particular operating system, application, or other configuration that you are familiar with, you can first create a custom image and select it when creating an instance to increase efficiency. For more information, see [Creating Instances via Images](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/36304).
- If you want to purchase an instance with the same configurations as those of the current instance, you can directly create an instance with the same configurations. For more information, see [Purchasing with Same Configurations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/36303).
