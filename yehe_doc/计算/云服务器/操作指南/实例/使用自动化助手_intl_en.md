## Overview
TencentCloud Automation Tools (TAT) is a native operations and deployment tool for CVM and Lighthouse instances. You don't need to connect to the instance remotely. TAT can automatically execute shell commands in batch to complete tasks such as running automation scripts, polling processes, installing/uninstalling software, updating applications and installing patches. For more information, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1147/46034).

This document describes how to use TAT to execute commands for instance management.

## Prerequisites
The TAT agent is installed on the CVM instance. See [Installing TAT Agent](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1147/46042).


<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Some existing CVM instances do not currently support the use of TAT. It's expected that TAT will be supported on all instances later.
