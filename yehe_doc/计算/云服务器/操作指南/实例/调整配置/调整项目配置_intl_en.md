## Overview
This project feature is used to manage cloud resources by project. When a CVM instance is created, it must be assigned to a project. Tencent Cloud allows users to reassign an instance to a new project after the instance is created.



<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
To assign an instance to a new project, create a project first.For more information on how to create a project, refer to [New Project](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/34726).
