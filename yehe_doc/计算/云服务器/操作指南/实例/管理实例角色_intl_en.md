## Overview
A Cloud Access Management (CAM) role is a virtual identity with a collection of permissions. It is used to grant the role entity the permissions to access services and resources and perform operations in Tencent Cloud. You can associate the CAM role with a CVM instance to call other Tencent Cloud APIs from the instance using the periodically updated temporary Security Token Service (STS) key. This ensures the security of your SecretKey and helps you implement refined permission control, avoiding the security risks from using persistent keys.

This document describes how to bind, modify, and delete a role.

## Advantages
Binding a CAM role to instances comes with the following features and advantages.
- You can use the STS temporary key to access other Tencent Cloud services.
- You can grant roles associated with different access policies to instances so that the instances are given different access permissions to Tencent Cloud resources, which helps you implement refined permission control.
- You donâ€™t need to save SecretKey in an instance. Instead, you can easily control the access permissions of the instance by changing the role authorization.




## Notes
- The instance only allows the role entity that contains `cvm.qcloud.com` to assume the role. For more information, see [Concepts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/19421).
- The instance must reside in a VPC.
- An instance can only bind one CAM role at a time.
- You can bind, modify or delete a role without paying extra fees.
