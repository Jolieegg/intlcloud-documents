## Scenario

This document describes how to create a Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instance. The custom configuration mode is used as an example.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a CVM instance, complete the following steps:
- You need to [sign up for Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985), and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).
- To create a CVM instance whose network type is virtual private cloud (VPC), you need to [create a VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805) in the target region, and [create a subnet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31806) in the target availability zone under the VPC.
- If you do not use the default project created automatically by the system, you need to [create a project](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/34726).
- If you do not use the default security group, you need to [create a security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34271) in the target region and add a security group rule that meets your business requirements.
- To bind an SSH key pair when creating a Linux instance, you need to [create SSH keys](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16691) for the target project.
- To create a CVM instance with a custom image, you need to [create custom images](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942) or [import an image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4945).

## Directions

1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com). Choose **Products** > **Compute** > **[Cloud Virtual Machine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cvm)**. Click **Get Started** and **Create** to enter the CVM purchase page.
 - **[Quick Configuration](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cvm?tab=lite):** This is applicable to general scenarios, helping users quickly purchase a CVM instance that meets general requirements.
 - **[Custom Configuration](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cvm?tab=custom):** This is applicable to specific scenarios, allowing users to purchase a CVM instance that meets specific requirements.
2. Configure the following information as prompted by the page:
<table>
<tr><th style="width: 20%">Category</th><th style="width: 12%">Required/Optional</th><th>Configuration Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Billing Method</td><td>Required</td><td>Select based on actual needs:<ul><li><b>Pay-As-You-Go</b>: a flexible billing method suitable for scenarios such as e-commerce flash sales where the demand fluctuates sharply and suddenly.</li><li><b>Spot Instance</b>: a new instance operation mode suitable for scenarios such as big data computing, online businesses with load balancing, and website services. The general price range is 10%-20% of pay-as-you-go instance.</li></ul>For more information on billing methods, please see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180">Billing Method Description</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Region/Availability Zone</td><td>Required</td><td><ul><li><b>Region</b>: we recommend you select the region closest to your customers to reduce access latency and increase access speed.</li><li><b>Availability Zone</b>: select based on actual needs.</br>If you want to purchase multiple CVMs, we recommend you select different availability zones to implement disaster recovery.</li></ul>For more information on regions and availability zones, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6091">Regions and Availability Zones</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Network</td><td>Required</td><td>Logically isolated space built on Tencent Cloud. A virtual private cloud (VPC) includes at least one subnet. The system provides a default VPC and subnet for each region.</br>
If the existing VPC or subnet does not meet your requirements, you can create a VPC or subnet in the VPC console.</br><b>Note</b>:<ul><li>resources in the same VPC can be shared within the private network.</li><li>When purchasing the CVM, ensure that the CVM and the subnet where the CVM is created have the same availability zones.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Instance</td><td>Required</td><td>Tencent Cloud provides different instance types based on the underlying hardware. To optimize performance, we recommend you use instance types of the latest generation.</br>
For more information on instances, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518">Instance Specifications</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Image</td><td>Required</td><td>Tencent Cloud provides public images, custom images, and shared images. For more information on images, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4941">Image Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">System Disk</a></td><td>Required</td><td>Used to install the operating system. The capacity is 50 GB by default.</br>Available Cloud Block Storage (CBS) types vary by regions. Select as instructed by the page.</br>For more information on CBS, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">CBS Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">Data Disk</a></td><td>Optional</td><td>Used to scale up CVM storage capacity to ensure high efficiency and reliability. CBS data disks are not added by default.</br>For more information on CBS, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">CBS Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Public Network Bandwidth</td><td>Required</td><td>A free independent public IP address is allocated by default.</br>Tencent Cloud provides two network billing modes. Configure a value greater than 0 Mbit/s as needed.<ul><li><b>Bill-By-Bandwidth</b>: select a fixed bandwidth. Packet loss occurs when the bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where network connection fluctuates slightly.</li><li><b>Bill-By-Traffic</b>: billing is based on traffic that is actually used. You can specify a peak bandwidth to prevent charges incurred by unexpected traffic. Packet loss occurs when the instantaneous bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where network connection fluctuates significantly.</li></ul><b>Note</b>: the allocated free independent public IP cannot be unbound from the instance. To unbind this IP address, first convert the public IP to an elastic IP. For more information on elastic IP, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733">Elastic Public IP</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Public Gateway</td><td>Optional</td><td>Applicable only to Linux images.</br>As a network interface between the VPC and the public network, the public gateway can forward requests of CVMs that are within different subnets of the VPC and have no public IP addresses.</br><b>Notes: </b>Tencent Cloud no longer support configuring public gateway on the CVM purchase page after December 6, 2019. To configure it, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34835">Configure Public Network Gateway</a>.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Quantity</td><td>Required</td><td>Number of CVMs to be purchased.</td></tr>
