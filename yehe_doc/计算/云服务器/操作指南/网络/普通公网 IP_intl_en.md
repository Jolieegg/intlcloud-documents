## Overview
This document describes how to use the common public IP address. The common public IP can only be assigned when you purchase a CVM and cannot be unbound from the CVM.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- For traditional accounts, when unbinding the EIP from CVM, each account can reallocate a common public IP 10 times per day for free.
- Only BGP IPs are applicable for the current common public IP addresses.
