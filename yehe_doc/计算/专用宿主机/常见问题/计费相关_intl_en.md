### What are the billing methods for CDH instances?

Currently, CDH instances are sold on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Is there a charge for assigning dedicated CVMs on a CDH instance?

Purchase of a CDH instance includes the physical server's CPU, memory, and local storage resources. Therefore, no extra fees will be incurred when you assign dedicated CVMs on a CDH instance that you have purchased. However, you need to pay for the cloud disks and public network bandwidth mounted on the dedicated CVMs.
