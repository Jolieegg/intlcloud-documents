### What is the difference between a CDH instance and a common CVM?
A CDH instance is a dedicated physical server equipped with a virtualized environment, which is completely isolated from the servers of other tenants with all its resources exclusive for your use. After purchasing a CDH instance, you can use it by assigning dedicated CVM instances on it, schedule its physical machine resources, and customize dedicated CVM configurations. A common CVM is a physical server whose resources are shared by multiple tenants.

### Do CDH instances support capacity expansion?
No. CDH instances are physical machines and their hardware configurations cannot be modified after purchase. Please evaluate your requirements carefully before purchasing CDH instances.
