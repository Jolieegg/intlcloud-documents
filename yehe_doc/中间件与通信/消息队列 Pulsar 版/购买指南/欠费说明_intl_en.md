>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

## Notes

- When you no longer use pay-as-you-go TDMQ for Pulsar resources, terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
- After TDMQ for Pulsar is terminated/repossessed, the data in it will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- As your actual resource consumption may change over time, there may be some deviation in the balance alert.

## Overdue Payment Reminder

Pay-as-You-Go resources are billed on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.

## Overdue Payment Policy

You can continue to use TDMQ for Pulsar for 2 hours after your account balance becomes negative. We will also continue to bill you for this period. After 2 hours, the TDMQ for Pulsar service will be stopped, and billing will also stop.

After the service is stopped, the system will process TDMQ for Pulsar as follows:


<table><tr>
<th>Time after service suspension</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
<td rowspan="2">â‰¤ 15 days</td>
<td>If your account is topped up to a positive balance, the billing will continue, and you can restart TDMQ for Pulsar.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>If your account balance remains negative, TDMQ for Pulsar cannot be restarted.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>>15 days</td>
<td>If your account is not topped up to a positive balance, your pay-as-you-go TDMQ for Pulsar resources will be repossessed and released. All data will be deleted and cannot be recovered. When your resources are repossessed, your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.</td>
