>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

## Notes

- When you no longer use pay-as-you-go TDMQ for CMQ resources, terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
- After a TDMQ for CMQ resource is terminated/repossessed, the data in it will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- As your actual resource consumption may change over time, there may be some deviation in the balance alert.

## Overdue Payment Reminder

When your account balance becomes negative, your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.

## Overdue Payment Policy

You can continue to use TDMQ for CMQ for 24 hours after your account balance becomes negative. We will also continue to bill you for this period. After 24 hours, the TDMQ for CMQ service will be stopped but will still incur resource usage fees.

After the service is stopped, the system will process TDMQ for CMQ as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Time after service suspension</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td align="left" rowspan="2">â‰¤ 7 days</td>
<td align="left">If your account is topped up to a positive balance, the billing will continue, and you can restart TDMQ for CMQ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">If your account balance remains negative, TDMQ for CMQ cannot be restarted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">> 7 days</td>
<td align="left">If your account is not topped up to a positive balance, your pay-as-you-go TDMQ for CMQ resources will be terminated. All data will be deleted and cannot be recovered. When your resources are terminated, your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.</td>
