API Gateway shared instances suport two billing modes: Pay-as-you-go (default) and resource packs. This document describes pay-as-you-go billable items and prices.  For details of resource packs, see [Resource Pack Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/38407).

## Billable items

Shared instance fees include API call fees and traffic fees.

### API calls

| Billable item | API calls |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Billing mode | Pay-as-You-Go |
| Billing cycle | Hourly |
|Bill issuing time | The API Gateway bill is calculated on an hourly basis. The bill is issued about 30 minutes after the end of the current billing cycle. After a bill is generated, the fees is automatically deducted from your account balance. |
| Deduction method | After a bill is generated, the fees will be automatically deducted from your account balance for settlement. |
| Currency | CNY |
| Billalble calls | API calls are bill if they are received by API Gateway and not considered [frontend errors](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/31717) . |

**After the API Gateway service is activated, the first one million calls in each calendar month in the first year are free of charge, and excessive calls will be billed at the tiered prices.**

### Public network outbound traffic

**Public network outbound traffic refers to the outbound traffic from API Gateway to clients**. It is pay-as-you-go by the used public network traffic and settled hourly.

| Private network outbound traffic | Traffic going from the API Gateway to backend services over the Tencent Cloud private network        | Free of charge                                                         |
| Private network inbound traffic | Traffic going from the clients to API Gateway over the Tencent Cloud private network          | Free of charge                                                         |
| Public network outbound traffic | Traffic going from API Gateway to clients or backend services over the Internet.| Unit price/GB * Total outbound traffic in an hour. |
| Public network inbound traffic | Traffic generated by data transferred from the client to API Gateway over the Internet              | Free of charge                                                         |

> ?If your backend business and API Gateway are in different regions, or the backend business is not in Tencent Cloud, the fees generated by the traffic from API Gateway to your backend business will be billed additionally.

## Pricing

### API call fees

| Tier | Monthly Calls (N) | Unit Price (USD/10,000 Calls) |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Free tier | The first million calls in each calendar month in the first year are free of charge | 0 |
| Tier 1 |  0 < N ≤ 10 million | 0.0089 |
| Tier 2 | 10 million < N ≤ 100 million | 0.0059 |
| Tier 3 | N > 100 million | 0.0045 |

### Public network outbound traffic price

| Region | Price (Unit: USD/GB) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------: |
| Chinese mainland, Singapore, Jakarta, Seoul, Tokyo, Frankfurt, and Moscow | 0.12                 |
| Hong Kong (China)                                  | 0.15                 |

**Billing example**
Suppose you purchase an EIP in Guangzhou region and use a total of 10 GB traffic between 07:00:00-07:59:59, then at 8:00:00, the payable fees will be 0.12 USD/GB * 10 GB = 0.12 USD.

>?
> - The traffic units are 1024-based, which means 1 TB = 1,024 GB, and 1 GB = 1,024 MB.
> - Public network traffic refers to the downstream traffic (in bytes), which is the application-layer data. During actual data transfer, the traffic generated over the network is around 5-15% more than the application-layer traffic, so the traffic calculated by Tencent Cloud may be about 10% more than that calculated by users themselves on the server.
>   - TCP/IP headers consumption: For TCP/IP-based HTTP requests, each packet can be up to 1,500 bytes and includes a 40-byte TCP and IP header, which generate traffic during transfer but cannot be counted by the application layer. The overhead of this part is around 3%.
>   - TCP retransmission: During normal data transfer over the network, around 3-10% of packets are lost on the Internet and retransmitted by the server. This type of traffic cannot be counted by the application layer and accounts for 3-7% of the total traffic.

## Billing examples

For a customer in Guangzhou region, the API calls in every month of the first year is less than 1 million, it’s all free of charge. Starting from the second year: 
The backend service is in a different region from API Gateway and receives five million API calls in a month, each of which returns a response of about 3 KB in size, and the size of each request of data forwarded from API Gateway to the backend service is 1 KB.

- API Gateway call fees = 5 million * 0.0089 USD/10,000 calls = 4.4 USD
- Total data transfer = 5 million * 3 KB = 15 million KB ≈ 14.3 GB
- Total out-of-plan data transfer = 5 million * 1 KB = 5 million KB ≈ 4.77 GB
- Total data transfer fee =  14.3 GB * 0.12 USD/GB + 4.77 GB * 0.12 USD/GB ≈ 2.29 USD
- Total fee = 4.4 USD + 2.29 USD = 6.74 USD
## Refund policy

Pay-as-you-go instances can be released at any time, and then the billing will stop.

## Others

- For more information on the API Gateway overdue payment policy (data retention and destruction), see [Notes on Overdue Payment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11934).
- Public network outbound traffic fees but not API call fees are charged for APIs connected to WebSocket on the backend currently.
