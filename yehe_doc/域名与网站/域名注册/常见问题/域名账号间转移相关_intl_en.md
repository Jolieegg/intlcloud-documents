### Will website access be affected if I transfer both domain registration and DNS query during cross-account domain transfer?
- Website access will not be affected by cross-account domain transfer if you use a server outside the Chinese mainland and have completed identity verification before and after the transfer.

- Suppose you use a server in the Chinese mainland and have completed identity verification and ICP filing before and after the cross-account domain transfer, website access will not be affected if the domain registration information is consistent with the filing information; otherwise, you need to change the filing information as required as soon as possible, as your website will remain accessible only for a short period of time.
