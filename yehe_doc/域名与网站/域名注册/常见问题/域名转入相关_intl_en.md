# Domain Transfer-In

### Is domain transfer-in free of charge?

Domain transfer-in is free of charge, but according to the regulations of the registry, you must renew your domain for another year upon transferring it in (i.e. you need to extend the expiration date for the domain before transfer-in by one year). Different domain suffixes have different renewal prices. For detailed billing information, see Domain Pricing.
>!
>- If an expired domain was renewed at the original registrar less than 45 days ago, transferring it in may be successful but its usage period may not be extended.
>- If your domain has already reached the limit for renewal (10 years), the usage period of the domain may fail to be extended by one year after the domain is successfully transferred in.

 ### How long does it take to transfer a domain in?
 Domain transfer-in usually takes 5â€“7 business days, subject to the handling time of the registry. Please wait patiently.


### Does domain transfer-in affect DNS resolution, website ICP filing, or the usage of the current website business or email?
Transferring a domain in to Tencent Cloud does not affect the original DNS resolution.

### Will the DNS records of a domain be transferred as well when the domain is transferred in?
No. After a domain is successfully transferred in, its DNS records are still hosted by the original DNS service provider.

### Can a domain be transferred out immediately after it is transferred in?
It depends on whether you have selected the option **Enable 60-Day Inter-Registrar Transfer Lock** during the domain transfer-in. If you have selected the option, you will not be able to apply for transferring out the domain within 60 days, and the status cannot be modified. You need to wait until the lock period ends before you can transfer the domain out.


### How do I modify the information of a domain after it is transferred in to Tencent Cloud?
Disable the domain protection feature, and click **Edit** to modify the domain information. For more information, see Modifying Domain Information.
