### What is a domain auth-code?

A domain auth-code is the authorization code for domain transfer. To get it, contact the original registrar, who usually sends the auth-code via email after verifying the domain identity. Then, you can successfully transfer in your domain within **3â€“7** days.

### How do I get the domain auth-code?

You can submit a domain transfer-out application to the original registrar to get the domain auth-code.
To transfer a domain, you must get an **auth-code** from the original registrar.
In general, you can have the auth-code quickly sent to the email address of the domain owner in the original registrar's system. If you cannot do so, contact the original registrar or its agent to manually request an auth-code or domain transfer-out. Then, the original registrar will provide instructions.

### What should I do if the agent refuses to provide an auth-code?

If you purchased the domain from an agent of a registrar such as www.net.cn and www.west.cn, and the agent refuses to provide an auth-code, follow the steps below:  
1. Make a complaint to the registrar such as www.net.cn.  

2. If the registrar also refuses to cooperate, make complaints to registries such as ICANN and CNNIC.

### What's the time limit for me to submit domain transfer-in at the new registrar after getting the domain auth-code?

A domain auth-code is valid for five days. After getting the auth-code, you should submit domain transfer-in at the new registrar within the validity period as soon as possible; otherwise, you need to get a new auth-code.
