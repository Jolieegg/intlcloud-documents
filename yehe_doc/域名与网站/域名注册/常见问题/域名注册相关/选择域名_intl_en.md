### How do I select a proper domain?
- A domain should be simple, easy to remember, and personalized, preferably associated with your enterprise name, trademark, and product, and tailored to your website nature, purpose, and target customer group.

- You can register different suffixes for your domain to protect your brand and make it easier for users to find your website.

- We recommend that you register and purchase a domain for more than two years to avoid loss due to the price rise or forgetting to renew the domain.


### What should I do if a domain has been registered?

A domain is unique, which means that a registered domain cannot be registered again. If you want to register `dnspod.com` but it has already been registered, search for another suffix such as `dnspod.net` or `dnspod.cn`. Domains with different suffixes are used in the same way.
