### When will an expired domain take effect after renewal?
About 30 days (may vary by suffix) after a domain expires is the renewal grace period, during which you can renew it at the normal renewal price. For detailed directions, see [Domain Renewal](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42872). After this period ends, your domain will enter the domain redemption period of about 30 days. For more information on the domain redemption period, see below.  
If you renew your domain during the renewal grace period and it is resolved by DNSPod, its DNS will be recovered within 72 hours after successful renewal, while DNS of domains not resolved by DNSPod will be recovered within 48–72 hours after successful renewal.

### What is the domain redemption period?
After your domain expires, there will be a domain renewal grace period of about 30 days, which may vary by suffix. If you fail to renew it during this period, it will enter the domain redemption period, which may also vary by suffix.

- The domain redemption period of Chinese mainland domains (such as .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, and .ac.cn domains) is about 15 days. If you fail to redeem your domain within this period, it will become available for public registration again.
- The domain redemption period of international domains (such as .com, .net, .org, .club, and .xyz domains) is about 30 days. If you fail to redeem your domain within this period, it will enter the deletion waiting period of 5 days, during which it cannot be renewed or redeemed and can only wait to be deleted. After the waiting period ends, it will become available for public registration again.

For example, for a domain whose renewal grace period and redemption period are both about 30 days, if it is currently in the renewal grace period, it may be still in the renewal grace period or have entered the redemption period on the 30th day; if the latter is the case, a Chinese mainland domain will be deleted on the 45th day, while an international domain will enter the deletion waiting period of 5 days on the 60th day.
>?Within 30 days after a domain expires, its status will change from renewable to redeemable. We recommend you renew it within 29 days after it expires.

### How do I redeem a domain?
If your domain is in the renewal grace period, you don't need to redeem it and only need to renew it normally.
After the renewal grace period ends, your domain will be in the domain redemption period of about 30 days, during which you can redeem it only by paying higher than the normal renewal price.
Directions on domain redemption:
1. Log in to the [Domains console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/domain/mydomain).
2. On the **All Domains** list page, select the domain to be redeemed and click **Redemption Period** to pop up the **Renew** window. You can also select **More** > **Renew** in the **Operation** column.
3. In the pop-up window, click **Confirm** and make the payment to redeem the domain.

>- If a domain is in the redemption period, it can be redeemed only at a price higher than the normal renewal price. The domain redemption fees are charged by the registry. For detailed prices, see [Domain Pricing](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/domain/price?type=overview).
>- If you have any questions, [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support).



### How long can a domain be renewed?
As stipulated by the registry, the total validity period of a domain cannot exceed 10 years (or 5 years for .co domains). If you select the 3-year validity period when purchasing your domain, you can renew it for 2 years if it is a co. domain or 7 years if it is not.
>?During domain redemption, you can renew the domain for only one year. If you want to renew it for multiple years, renew it after redeeming it.

### Can I renew an expired domain?
Yes. In normal cases, a domain that expired not long ago is still in the renewal grace period and can be normally renewed. For detailed directions on renewal, see [Domain Renewal](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42872).

 - If your domain expired less than 30 days ago, it is still in the renewal grace period, and you can renew it normally. After successful renewal, it will be restored to normal.
 - If your domain expired more than 30 days ago, it is in the redemption period, and you can redeem it only by paying a higher price. After redemption, it will be restored to normal.
 - If an expired domain is no longer in your account, generally it cannot be restored, and you can register it again after it is completely deleted.  

### Why can't I access my domain after renewing it?
After a domain is renewed successfully, it will take effect within 72 hours by default, so you need to wait patiently. If it is still inaccessible after this period, [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support).


### What are the domain expiration states?
- In about 30 days after a domain expires, WHOIS lookup shows that the domain is in "REGISTRAR HOLD" status, i.e., so-called renewal grace period.
- After the registrar hold period (renewal grace period) ends, the domain will enter the redemption period of about 30 days, and WHOIS lookup shows that the domain is in "REDEMPTION PERIOD" status.
- After the redemption period of an international domain ends, it will enter the deletion waiting period of 5 days, during which WHOIS lookup shows that the domain is in "PENDING Delete" status and after which the domain will be deleted and available for registration again.
- "REGISTRAR/REGISTRY LOCK" is the registrar/registry lock status, which is used to prevent a domain from being transferred to another registrar after expiration.
