>- **Domains are one-off products that are not modifiable or refundable after successful registration.**
>- The domain registration, renewal, and transfer-in prices will be adjusted based on the market conditions, and these prices of a platinum domain may be higher than those of a standard domain. The actual prices will apply.
>- After you submit an order and make the payment, Tencent Cloud only submits an application as a registrar on your behalf, and does not guarantee successful registration.
>- According to the policy of Tencent Cloud International, the domain registration service is subject to a prepaid allowlist mechanism. If you cannot submit an order to purchase a domain, please submit a ticket to apply for qualifications. Sorry for any inconvenience.
>- Both newly registered domains and transferred-in domains are regarded as purchases, for which you cannot use Tencent Cloud domain renewal vouchers.
