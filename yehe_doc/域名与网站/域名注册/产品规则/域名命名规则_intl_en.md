 When applying for a domain name, you can first learn about the naming rules of domain prefixes. Different suffixes have different naming rules. In order to successfully register a domain name and pass the domain naming review, you must follow corresponding domain naming rules. You can apply to register an exclusive domain name for your business.

## Naming Rules of Chinese Domain Prefixes
When you register a Chinese domain name, please follow the domain naming rules below:
- A Chinese domain name must contain at least one Chinese character, and the rest can be English letters (a-z, case-insensitive), digits (0-9), and `-`.
- In most domain registries, the Simplified Chinese version and Traditional Chinese version of a domain name are equivalent. Therefore, you only need to register one of them. For example, if you have registered a domain name in Simplified Chinese, you won’t be able to register its Traditional Chinese version, and vice versa.
- The domain name cannot start or end with invalid characters such as `-`, `+`, `@`, `&`, and space.
- The domain name cannot contain only English letters or digits.
- Hyphen `-` cannot appear consecutively, be registered independently, or be placed at the beginning or end.
- The length of the domain name after converted to Punycode cannot exceed 63 characters.
- Some domain suffixes such as `.com.cn`, `.net.cn`, and `.org.cn` do not support Chinese prefixes.

## Naming Rule of English Domain Prefixes
When you register an English domain name, follow the domain naming rules below:
- Use English letters (a-z, case-insensitive), digits (0-9), and hyphen `-` only.
- Do not use spaces and special characters such as `!`, `$`, `&`, and `?`.
- Hyphen `-` cannot appear consecutively, be registered independently, or be placed at the beginning or end.
- The length of the domain cannot exceed 63 characters.
