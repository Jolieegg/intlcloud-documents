## Overview

Domain push is a point-to-point transaction mode. A domain transaction loop is closed after the buyer accepts the domain transferred by the seller.
After the domain seller and buyer make a deal, the seller can transfer the domain to the buyer via domain push.


>! 
> - Tencent Cloud is just an online platform for domain transaction services and cannot issue invoices for payments involved in transactions.
> - Currently, Tencent Cloud supports only free push but not push with domain prices.
