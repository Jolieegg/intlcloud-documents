Domain registration is essentially to pay for the right to use a domain for one or multiple years. You can easily get your domain in several simple steps:

## Step 1. Query the domain
Before registering a domain, you need to query whether the domain or its suffix has already been registered by somebody else, and if so, you need to choose an unregistered domain or suffix before proceeding to the next step.

1. Log in on the [Domain Registration](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/domain/buy) page.
2. On the **Domain Registration** page, enter the target domain and suffix and click <span ><img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0cc93679f33e50d7c6b3fea4d9110cc1.png" style="margin-bottom:-5px;"/></span> to view its registration status as shown below:
For example, enter `example.com`.

 - If the returned query result shows **Registered**, the domain has already been registered, and you need to change the domain or suffix.
 - If the returned query result shows **Add to Cart**, the domain can be registered.

## Step 2. Add to cart

1. Select the domain to be registered such as `example.com` and click **Add to Cart**.
>? You can also add multiple suffixes to protect your brand; for example, you can add `example.cn`, `example.net`, and `example.org` to the cart.
2. In the **cart** on the right, click **Purchase Now**.

## Step 3. Enter the domain information

1. On the **Submit Order** page, confirm the domain purchase term, enter the domain information, and select **I have read and agree to Tencent Cloud Domain Registration Agreement and Tencent Cloud Privacy Policy**.
 - In the domain information, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years are displayed as purchase term options by default. If you want to select another period such as 7 years, click **Other** and select 7 years.
 - You can enter the domain owner information in the following two ways:
    - If you have purchased a domain before, you can use the previously entered domain information.
    - If you want to use new domain information, we recommend you create a template as shown below:

2. Click **Submit Order**.

## Step 4. Check the information

2. Click **Confirm** to enter the payment page.
