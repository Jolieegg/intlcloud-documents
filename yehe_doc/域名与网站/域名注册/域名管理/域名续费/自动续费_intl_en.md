## Overview

If you don't want to manually renew a domain, Tencent Cloud provides the auto renewal feature. After it is enabled, the system will automatically renew a domain before it expires. You need to make sure that your account balance is sufficient; otherwise, renewal will fail.

>!
>- Starting from April 2020, domains with auto renewal enabled will be renewed 14 days before expiration.
>- If renewal fails due to insufficient account balance, the system will retry renewing until the renewal succeeds or the renewal grace period ends.
>- A domain that fails to be renewed will enter the redemption period and may be released and deleted eventually. Keep your account balance sufficient to prevent automatic renewal failures.
>- Once expired, a domain cannot be transferred out. You need to renew it before transferring it out. For more applicable rules, see [Domain Transfer Out Rules](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42858).
>- Within 30 days after a domain expires, its status will change from renewable to redeemable. We recommend you renew it within 29 days after it expires.
