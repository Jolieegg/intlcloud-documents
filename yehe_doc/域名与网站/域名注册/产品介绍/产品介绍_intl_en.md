## Domain Name Overview
There are tens of millions of hosts on the internet. Each host is allocated an IP address to be distinguished from one another. However, an IP address doesn't have any actual meaning to it which makes it hard to be remembered, and this is why domain names come into play.
A domain name, comprised of letters, digits, `-`, `.`, and other symbols, is an easy-to-remember server address (such as website, email, and FTP) designed for better communication.
A domain name corresponds to an IP. A specialized domain name server (DNS) on the internet is used to translate between domain names and IPs. When you enter a domain name in your browser, DNS will translate it into an IP to locate an appropriate server and open the requested page.
If you want to set up a server to publish information on the internet, you need to register a domain name first, which is a basic for establishing services on the internet. Since the registration of domain names follows the rule of "first to apply, first to register" and every registered domain name must be unique on the internet, you are advised to register your domain name as soon as possible.


## Domain Registration
According to international practices, the application for domain names follows the rule of "first to apply, first to serve". Since every registered domain name must be unique, each domain name corresponds to a single computer host. Once a domain name is applied for, it belongs to the applicant during the registration period, unless the applicant gives it up or transfers it to someone else. You are advised to apply for your own exclusive domain name in time.
- **Domain registration**: if you want to set up a server to publish information on the internet, you need to register a domain name first.
 - **Domain registration**：
    Log in to the domain registration page, select a domain suffix, add it to the card, enter domain information, and complete the payment. Then you can go on to complete identity verification.
 - **DNS resolution**:
 When you enter a domain name in your browser to visit a website, the domain name will be translated to an IP to find the corresponding server and open the requested page. For more information about DNS resolution, see [Adding Record](https://docs.dnspod.com/dns/5faa06d691e2ca46b29ff43e/).
- **Domain transfer to Tencent Cloud**: if you have a domain name registered with another registrar and want to host it with Tencent Cloud, you can transfer it to Tencent Cloud.
 - **Domain transfer-in**
    Before transferring your domain name, check the [prerequisites](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/242/45180) carefully and obtain the transfer code from your current registrar. For detailed instructions on domain transfer-in, see [Domain Transfer to Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42877).

## Domain Management
The Tencent Cloud Domains console provides commonly used management features to ensure the efficient use of your domain names. The following shows the main features for domain management:
- **Domain renewal and redemption**:
   - **Domain renewal**: before your domain name expires, Tencent Cloud will send an email or SMS message to remind you to renew it. For the renewal process, see [Domain Renewal](link). For renewal fees, see [Domain Pricing Table](link).
   - **Domain redemption**: within about 30 days after your domain name expires, it is in the renewal period. If you don’t renew the domain name within the renewal period, it will enter the redemption period. For the redemption process, see [Domain Redemption](link).
- **Domain information maintenance**: for instructions on domain information modification, see [Domain Information Modification](link).
- **DNS resolution**:
  Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Domains console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/domain), go to **My Domains**, find the domain name for which you want to manage DNS resolution, and click **DNS** in the **Operation** column to view its records.
- **Domain transfer**:
  - **Cross-account domain transfer**: when you transfer a domain name under account A to account B, the DNS resolution permission over the domain name still belongs to account A, while account B will have the permission to manage it, including modifying its information and transferring it. For more information, see [Cross-Account Domain Transfer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42875).
  - **Domain transfer out of Tencent Cloud**: you can transfer a domain name from Tencent Cloud to another domain registrar, which will continue to provide domain name services for you. We call this domain transfer-out. For more information, see [Transferring Domains Out of Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42876).
- **Domain security maintenance**:
  To avoid security issues with your domain name, you are advised to enable the **transfer prohibition lock** and **update prohibition lock**. For operation instructions, see [Enabling Domain Security Protection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/42864).
