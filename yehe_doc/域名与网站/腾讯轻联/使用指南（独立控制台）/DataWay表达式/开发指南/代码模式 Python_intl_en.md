3. After editing the script, click **Confirm**.

### Feature description
The editor provides various IDE-like features, including syntax check, formatting, script debugging, autocomplete, and code highlighting.

- **Syntax check**
The Python script editor can check the syntax of the Python script in real time and display conspicuous prompts on the left of the script editing window and below the incorrect code. When you hover over an error prompt, the detailed error message will be displayed.
You can modify the Python script based on the syntax prompts. Only code that passes the syntax check can be saved successfully.

- **Script debugging**
The Python script editor offers a debugging feature button. You can click the **Debug** icon in the top-right corner to debug the Python script online as instructed in [Script debugging](#dataway-debug).
<img src="https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/mh4d605_6.png" alt="" style="zoom:50%;" />


- **Autocomplete**
    When you input content in the textbox, the Python script editor will automatically display the syntax prompts based on the current context below the cursor. Generally, syntax prompts include built-in functions, keywords, and third-party modules.

- **Reference on the flow data panel**
In code mode, you can reference data on the flow data panel. For more information, see [Flow Data Panel](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51655#dataref).


- **Code highlighting**
The Python script editor highlights the Dataway code and completes parentheses and brackets by default.


## Script Structure

A complete script in Python code mode must be in compliance with Python 3 syntax and contain the entry function definition `def dw_process(msg)`, such as:
```python
def dw_process(msg):
    sq = func(3)
    val = {
        'square': sq,
        'data': msg.payload['realData'] + 1
    }
    return Entity.from_value(val, mime_type='application/json')
		
def func(x):
    return x*x
```

The `dw_process` entry function only accepts a parameter `msg`, which represents the message that Dataway needs to process currently. The returned value of the function is also the returned value of the script.

Enter the above expression in the **Set Payload** component. If the input message of the component is in JSON structure `{"realData": 123}`, the calculation output result of the Python script will be as follows:

```json
{
    "square": 9,
    "data": 124
}
```

## Basic Dataway Syntax Description

The Python code mode is implemented based on Python 3 syntax. This section describes the basic syntax of the Python code mode.

### Keyword

The Python code mode supports the following keywords. As reserved words in Python code mode, keywords won't be treated as any identifier name.

| Keyword   | Description |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| True         | Boolean value. `True` indicates true, which is opposite to `False`. |
| True         | Boolean value. `False` indicates false, which is opposite to `True`. |
| None         | Null.                          |
| and          | Logical AND.                         |
| or           | Logical OR.                         |
| not          | Logical NOT.                        |
| as           | Creates an alias.                        |
| assert       | Uses an assertion to test an expression.              |
| break        | Stops a loop statement.                      |
| continue     | Jumps out of the current loop.                      |
| def          | Defines a function.                          |
| if/else/elif | Forms a conditional statement.                          |
| for          | Forms a loop statement.                          |
| global       | Declares a global variable.                      |
| in           | Checks whether a value is present in an object.                |
| is           | Checks whether two variables refer to the same object.          |
| lambda       | Creates an anonymous function. A function can be implemented in a single line.  |
| nonlocal     | Declares a nonlocal variable in a nested function. This keyword can modify variables defined externally. |
| pass         | Null statement, which can be used as a placeholder.                         |
| raise | Throws an exception. |
| return | Returns the value of a function. |

### Line and indentation

The Python code mode identifies code blocks based on indentation. Different numbers of indentation spaces indicate different code levels. The number of indentation spaces at the same level must be the same.

### Operator

The Python code mode supports the following common operators, including arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical, and bitwise operators. Suppose variable `a` is `5` and `b` is `3`, the examples are as listed below:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| =          | Assignment.                 | c = 3                                    |
| +          | Addition.                   | a + b = 3                                |
| -          | Subtraction.                   | a - b = 2                                |
| *          | Multiplication.                   | a * b = 15                               |
| /          | Division.                   | 15 / a = b                               |
| %          | Modulus, which returns the remainder of a division. | 16 % b = 1                               |
| **         | Exponentiation.                   | a ** b = 125                             |
| //         | Returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the specified value.             | a // b = 1                               |
| +=         | Addition assignment.             | `c += a` is equivalent to `c = c + a`.                   |
| -=         | Subtraction assignment.             | `c -= a` is equivalent to `c = c - a`.                  |
| *=         | Multiplication assignment.             | `c *= a` is equivalent to `c = c * a`.                  |
| /=         | Division assignment.             | `c /= a` is equivalent to `c = c / a`.                  |
| ==         | Checks whether two values are equal.             | `a == b` returns `False`.                        |
| !=         | Checks whether two values are not equal.             | `a != b` returns `True`.                         |
| >          | Checks whether a value is greater than another.             | `a > b` returns `True`.                          |
| <          | Checks whether a value is less than another.             | `a < b` returns `False`.                        |
| >=         | Checks whether a value is greater than or equal to another.         | `a >= b` returns `True`.                         |
| <=         | Checks whether a value is less than or equal to another.         | `a <= b` returns `False`.                        |
| &          | Bitwise AND.               | a & b = 1(0101 & 0011 = 0001).            |
| \|         | Bitwise OR.               | a \| b = 7 (0101 & 0011 = 0111).          |
| ^          | Bitwise XOR.             | a ^ b = 6 (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110).           |
| ~          | Bitwise negation.             | ~a = -6.                                  |
| <<         | Left shift.           | a << 3 = 20 (0000 0101 << 3 = 0001 0100). |
| <<         | Right shift.           | a >> 1 = 2 (0101 >> 1 = 0010).            |

### Conditional and loop control statements

- The Python code mode uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for conditional control. For example, the value of `a` is checked to return different strings:
```python
def dw_process(msg):
    a = 100
    if a < 10:
        return 'a is lower than 10'
    elif a <= 100 and a >= 10:
        return 'a is between 10 and 100'
    else:
        return 'a is bigger than 100'
```
The execution result of the Dataway expression is `a is between 10 and 100`.

- The Python code mode uses the `for` loop for loop control. For example, a `for` loop is used to get the product of elements in `a`:
```python
def dw_process(msg):
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    num = 1
    for i in a:
        num *= i
    return num
```
The execution result of the Dataway expression is `24`.

### Function definition

In Python code mode, you can use the `def` keyword to define a function as follows: the `def` keyword is followed by a function name and parameter name list, the function definition line ends with a colon `:`, the next line is indented by default, and the entire function ends with a `return` statement; if no `return` statement is used, `None` will be returned.

After defining a function, you can call and execute it in another function. In Python code mode, the default entry function `dw_process` doesn't need to be declared manually. To customize a function, directly define it below the `dw_process` entry function. For example, a function `test()` is defined to calculate the sum of the list elements and is called in the `dw_process` function, and a `return` statement is used at the end to return the result:
```python
def dw_process(msg):
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    return add_list(a)

def add_list(alist):
    sum = 0
    for i in reversed(alist):
        sum += i
    return sum
```
The final output result is `10`.

### Module call

The Python code mode has various built-in third-party modules, including `time`, `json`, `math`, `base64`, `hmac`, `random`, ` hashlib`, `Crypto`, `socket`, `struct`, `decimal`, and `datetime`. When using a module, you can directly reference the module name without using the `import` keyword. For the specific function description, see [Expression Mode Appendix](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51658). For example, a JSON string is received and converted into a dictionary:
```python
def dw_process(msg):
    jsonStr = '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}'
    jsonDict = json.loads(jsonStr)  # Convert into a `dict` object
    num = 1
    for k, v in jsonDict.items():   # Traverse the `dict` object
        num += math.pow(v, 2)
    return num
```
The final output result is `15.0`.

### Comment

In Python code mode, single-line comments start with `#`, and you can use multiple `#` symbols, `'''`, or `"""` for multi-line comments. For example, execute the following code:
```python
# Dataway comment

'''
Dataway comment
Dataway comment
'''
 
"""
Dataway comment
Dataway comment
"""
def dw_process(msg):
    return 'Dataway Hello World!'
```

The output result is:
```python
Dataway Hello World!
```

>?The Python code mode provides the syntax check feature to check the syntax in real time and prompt errors when you write code. For the detailed syntax description, see [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3.5/reference/index.html).

## `dw_process` Entry Function
`dw_process` is the main entry function in Python code mode, which acts like the `main` function in C or C++.

`dw_process` only accepts a parameter of the [Message](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51655#message-explain) type, and its returned value is the output value of the script in Python code mode.

As a stage in the data processing process in iPaaS, the `dw_process` function currently supports [core types](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51655#core-types) for its returned value.

For more information on the data types and returned value in Python code mode, see [Data Type System](#dataway-types).


[](id:dataway-types)
## Data Type System
| Type | Description | Unique to Dataway | Example |
| ----- | ---- | --------------- | --- |
| str | String, i.e., native `str` type in Python. | No | "abc" |
| None | `None` in Python. | No | None |
| bool | Boolean, i.e., native `bool` type in Python. | No | True/False |
| float | Float, i.e., native `float` type in Python. | No | 123.123 |
| int | Integer, i.e., native `int` type in Python. | No | 123 |
| bytes | Byte array, i.e., `bytes` type in Python. | No | b'this_is_a_bytes' |
| set | Set, i.e., `set` type in Python. | No | {1,2,3} |
| list | List (a sequence container), i.e., native `list` type in Python. | No | [1,2,3] |
| dict | Dictionary (a key-value pair container), i.e., native `dict` type in Python. | No | {1:1, 'key': 'value'} |
| **Entity** | Entity data in iPaaS, which represents a binary object and is accessed as an `Entity` object in Dataway. It contains information such as `blob`, `mime_type`, and `encoding`. | Yes | `payload` in a message constructed by the HTTP Listener component, such as `msg.payload` |
| **MultiMap** | Multi-value map. Like `xml` but unlike `dict`, this type supports duplicate `key` values. | Yes | Object obtained after data in `application/www-form-urlencoded` format is parsed |
| **FormDataParts**| Array + list data structure, which is similar to `orderDict` in Python. | Yes | Object obtained after data in `multipart/form-data` format is parsed |
| **Message** | Message in iPaaS, which is accessed as a `Message` object in Dataway. | Yes | `msg` parameter in the `dw_process` entry function |


>!
>- The above types can be used in the Python code mode, but **the data type of the returned value of the `dw_process` function must be a [core type](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51655#core-types)**.
>- If the output value of a Dataway expression is the final result returned by the flow, the types supported for the returned value will also be subject to the flow components. If an HTTP Listener component is used as the first component in the flow, the final `payload` value must be of `Entity` type.


[](id:dataway-debug)
## Script Debugging

The Python code mode supports script debugging to help troubleshoot problems and verify the result. With this feature, you can manually define the input parameter `msg` and click **Test** to directly view the script execution result, debugging log, and error message.

1. Enter an expression in the script textbox.
In Dataway debugging mode, you can use the `print()` function in the expression to print the information to be observed. The printed message will be displayed on the UI after the script is executed.


2. Click the **Debug** icon in the top-right corner of the script editing window. In the simulated data configuration pop-up window, you can set the payload, attributes, and variables of `msg`. After completing the configuration, click **Start test**, and the system will automatically assemble a `msg` parameter and pass it to the `dw_process` function as the script input.


3. After the `dw_process` function is executed, the execution result and printed debugging log will pop up at the bottom of the editing window. If errors occur during execution, error messages will be displayed.
	- **Output**: It displays the execution result of the Dataway expression.

	- **Error**: It displays the script execution error message. If no errors occur, a green tick will be displayed.



## Other Support
The Python code mode provides various built-in functions and third-party modules for you to choose as needed to quickly implement predefined features. For more information, see [Python Appendix](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51660).
