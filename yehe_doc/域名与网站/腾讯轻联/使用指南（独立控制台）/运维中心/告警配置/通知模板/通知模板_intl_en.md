## Overview

This document describes how to configure a notification template in the alarm module in iPaaS.

You can quickly reuse a template for multiple policies to reduce repeated user notification configurations. You can customize the user notification methods; for example, you can configure alarm notification channels as Message Center, email, and SMS. You can also use different notification time periods for different users; for example, you can configure user A to receive alarm notifications in the daytime and user B to receive notifications at night.
You can create, edit, and delete notification templates.

## Prerequisites

- Viewing a notification template: The sub-account must have the project read permission in iPaaS.
- Creating/Editing/Deleting a notification template: The sub-account must have the project write permission in iPaaS.

> ?For more information on how to grant sub-accounts permissions, see [Granting Tencent Cloud Service Permissions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/36744).

## Use Limits

| Feature | Limit |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| User notification | Up to five items can be added. |
