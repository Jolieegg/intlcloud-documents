### How does iPaaS guarantee availability?

iPaaS guarantees availability in the following three ways:
1. Applications: iPaaS prevents the system from hitting performance bottlenecks. When a bottleneck occurs, it promptly triggers alarms and makes service adjustments.
2. Users: iPaaS assigns resource quotas to users. If a user exceeds their resource limit, that userâ€™s traffic is throttled without affecting other users.
3. Flows: iPaaS uses an auto-recovery mechanism to maintain the availability of flows.
