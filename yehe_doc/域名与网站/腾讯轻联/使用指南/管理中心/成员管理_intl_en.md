## Overview

iPaaS combines the account system of CAM and iPaaS's own permissions for permission control.
iPaaS automatically pulls all sub-accounts under the current root account to the member list. To add/delete a member, you need to switch from the iPaaS console to the CAM console. The root account is the system admin, who has the highest privileges in iPaaS and can set or unset a sub-account as the system admin. For more information, see [Member management](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1165/51649).
