Digicert root certificates are compatible with all browsers on the market and also best supports mobile devices. A TrustAsia wildcard certificate is also issued using a Digicert root certificate. A GlobalSign wildcard certificate is issued using a GlobalSign root certificate. A DNSPod certificate is issued using a Wotrus root certificate, and a Wotrus wildcard certificate is issued using a Sectigo root certificate.
