### Multi-year certificate
- A multi-year certificate is a purchasable certificate valid for years. When such certificate is about to expire, Tencent Cloud will automatically submit the certificate information to the CA for review, so that you don't need to initiate an application.

- SSL certificate processes are simplified and automated in the entire lifecycle covering application, validation, review, issue, and renewal.

- After you purchase an SSL certificate valid for more than one year from Tencent Cloud and the certificate information is reviewed, Tencent Cloud will automatically apply for a second one for you **within 30 calendar days before its expiration**. If the approval for your organization and domain remains valid, the second certificate will be issued without reapplication.
  

   > **Notes**
   > 
   >   - A new certificate will be issued upon approval after automatic review, and you need to replace the existing one with the new one.
   >   - "-" indicates certificates not available for now.

### Automatic information submission for review

SSL Certificate Service provides the automatic information submission feature; that is, you can enter the application information such as organization information and domain and complete domain validation and organization information review in advance on the **My Profile** page in the [SSL Certificate Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/certoverview), so that when you apply for an SSL certificate, Tencent Cloud will automatically complete the domain validation for the SSL certificate of a certain brand and submit the certificate for review, simplifying management.
During automatic review, the system will submit OV and EV SSL certificates as well as CS and EV_CS code signing certificates to the root CA. After approval, organization information review will be skipped when you apply for the corresponding certificate and type (otherwise, someone will get in touch via the contact information reserved for the certificate).

### International standard certificates for which automatic information submission for review is supported

The following table lists international standard certificates for which automatic information submission for review is supported.

> **Notes**
> 
>  For Chinese SM certificates or international standard certificates for which automatic information submission for review is not supported, domain validation and automatic information submission for review cannot be skipped, but you can quickly enter the existing organization information on the **My Profile** page.
