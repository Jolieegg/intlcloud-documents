> **Notes** 
>  Certificate Transparency (CT) is a policy for Google Chrome to monitor and review HTTPS certificates. Due to a kernel bug in Chrome 53/54, CT error occurs in all certificates of SecureSite CA issued after June 1, 2016. Chrome handled this problem with automatic patch immediately and fixed this issue in version 55. This issue doesn't affect users who can connect to Chrome's server. Since most users in the Chinese mainland cannot access Chrome's server, we recommend that you upgrade to version 55+ to solve this issue. In addition, QQ Browser using the kernel of Chromium 53/54 version is also affected.
