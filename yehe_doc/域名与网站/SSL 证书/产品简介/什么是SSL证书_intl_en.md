## Overview
SSL Certificates are also known as digital certificates. Tencent Cloud works with well-known Certificate Authorities (CA) to allow users to apply for, manage, and deploy free/paid SSL certificates, which enable HTTPS to identify identities and encrypt data for your websites, apps, and web APIs.


## SSL and HTTPS
An encrypted HTTP protocol based on the SSL certificate for secure data transmission enables a site to be switched from Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer (HTTPS).

After you purchase an SSL certificate via Tencent Cloud, you can ask CA to sign and issue it through the SSL Certificate Service console. Once the certificate is issued, you can download and deploy it to the web service of your server. Alternatively, you can deploy it to your Tencent Cloud resources with one click. In this way, your web services or cloud resources can transfer data over HTTPS.
