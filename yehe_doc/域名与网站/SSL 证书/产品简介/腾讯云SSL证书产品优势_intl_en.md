## Top CAs

SSL certificates are issued by leading global CAs and are safe and reliable. 
Certificate Authorities (CAs) are network agencies which manage and issue secure credentials and encryption information keys. The credibility and fairness of CAs are very important as they are responsible for public key validity verification in the public key system as well as user and enterprise identity verification. Therefore, Tencent Cloud only works with the most reputable CAs to provide secure SSL certificates.

## Encrypted data transfer

Encryption secures the data transfer between the browsers/Apps and servers.
Encrypted App and webpage communication via HTTPS can prevent data from being stolen and tampered in the course of transmission and guarantee data integrity; prevent traffic hijacking and advertisement inserting by ISPs, and effectively resist man-in-the-middle attacks, greatly improving the security.

## 100% compatibility (international standard certificates)

SecureSite root certificates can be issued for all browsers and mobile devices.
Compatibility determines whether security reminders will properly pop out when users access sites via browsers. SecureSite root certificates rank top in browser compatibility, supporting all mainstream browsers and mobile devices.

## Improved search ranking

HTTPS can help improve sitesâ€™ search rankings and credibility.
Google adjusted the search engine algorithm in 2014, as a result, HTTPS-encrypted websites rank higher in search results than HTTP sites. Search engine vendors in Mainland China are also stepping up their focus on HTTPS to fuel SEO. 


## Support for multi-year SSL certificates

SSL certificate processes are simplified and automated in the entire lifecycle covering application, validation, review, issue, and renewal, relieving you of the concern that global CAs won't issue SSL certificates with a validity period greater than 13 months.

## Comprehensive services

The following value-added services are supported:
- **Quick deployment to Tencent Cloud services**: SSL certificates can be quickly deployed to Tencent Cloud services such as CLB, CDN, CSS, and Anti-DDoS.

- **Extended service**: Certificates can be applied for and managed via APIs besides the console.

- **Hosting service**: With Tencent Cloud resource hosting, a new SSL certificate can be automatically deployed to the same Tencent Cloud resources such as CLB, CDN, CSS, and Anti-DDoS as the original certificate after renewal and issue. This reduces Ops costs caused by repeated deployment due to the validity period of the certificate.


## Fast refund

If you have paid for an SSL certificate order, but the application failed, the approval process was suspended, and the SSL certificate was not issued, you can request a refund at any time by performing a few simple operations in the console.
