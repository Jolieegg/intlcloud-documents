According to DigiCert's notice, DigiCert launched a private key compromise detection system in late April 2020. The system automatically detects private key compromises on project code hosting platforms such as GitHub and SourceForge. If the system detects compromised private keys, DigiCert will notify subscribers and revoke the corresponding certificates after 24 hours.
To protect your website and information security, please keep your certificate's private key safe. Do not upload your private key to public networks to avoid incidents such as certificate revocation or information leakage.
