> - If the above issues exist, we recommend that you update to SSL certificates of other brands as soon as possible, thereby preventing the consequences of the Let's Encrypt root certificate expiration at the source.
> - Tencent Cloud does not sell or issue Let's Encrypt certificates, so you can ignore this notice if your SSL certificates are issued by Tencent Cloud.
