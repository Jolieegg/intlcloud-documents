Due to the changes in Apple and Googleâ€™s root store policies, as of September 1, 2020, newly issued SSL/TLS certificates with a validity period greater than 13 months (397 days) will be prohibited by policy and will not be trusted. Starting from September 1, 2020, global CAs will no longer issue 2-year SSL certificates. Tencent Cloud will also stop providing the 2-year SSL certificate purchase service from August 25, 2020. To purchase a 2-year SSL certificate, ensure that it is requested and issued before August 25, 2020.
