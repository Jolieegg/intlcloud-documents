Due to the policy adjustments of CAs and certificate agents, from January 1, 2018, you can apply for 20 free TrustAsia DV SSL certificates at most for one primary domain (the second-level domain and its subdomains, such as `tencent.com`, `ssl.tencent.com`, and `ssl.ssl.tencent.com`, belong to the same primary domain). Issued certificates will continue to be valid within their validity periods. If your business is affected by the adjustments, we recommend you purchase wildcard SSL certificates.

>!
>- From September 1, 2022, the quota for one Tencent Cloud UIN account to apply for a free certificate will be reduced from 50 to 20.
>- Thank you for your support for Tencent Cloud. We will continue to provide you with professional HTTPS services.
>- If you have problems when using the product, please feel free to [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support).
