## TrustAsia Root Certificate Update
As notified by TrustAsia, TrustAsia root certificates have changed from DigiCert root certificates to Sectigo root certificates since **March 3, 2022 22:00:00**. That is, the root certificates of TrustAsia SSL certificates applied before **March 3, 2022 22:00:00** were issued by DigiCert, and those applied after **March 3, 2022 22:00:00** are issued by Sectigo.

Sectigo root certificates support Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) nodes in the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the TrustAsia root certificate update greatly improves the HTTPS access speed of websites in the Chinese mainland.
