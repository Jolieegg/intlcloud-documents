Certificate Authorities (CAs) automatically detect private key compromises on project code hosting platforms such as GitHub and SourceForge. When detecting compromised private keys, they will notify subscribers and revoke the corresponding certificates 24 hours later.
To protect your website and information security, please keep your certificate's private key safe. Do not upload your private key to public networks to avoid incidents such as certificate revocation or information leakage.
