### Is the original SSL certificate still valid after the server IP address is changed?

If the SSL certificate is bound to a domain name, it is not affected by the change of the server IP address.
As long as the domain name bound with the SSL certificate remains unchanged, it can be resolved to the new IP address, and the original SSL certificate is still valid.
