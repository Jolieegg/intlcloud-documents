### Why does the order status not change after a notification email is received from a CA?

While reviewing your materials in the process of issuing your certificate, the CA may send an email to notify you of the progress of your certificate application. If the order status does not change in the Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service Console after you have received that email, it may be due to a delay in the CA pushing the order status to Tencent Cloud. Just be patient and the status will be updated in time.
