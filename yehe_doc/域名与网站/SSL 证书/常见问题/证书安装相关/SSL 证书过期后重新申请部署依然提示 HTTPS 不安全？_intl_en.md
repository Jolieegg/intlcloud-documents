### What should I do if I am prompted that HTTPS is not secure after reapplying for deployment upon expiration of the SSL certificate?

A browser will prompt that HTTPS is not secure after SSL certificate expiration. Specifically, you will still get this prompt when accessing a website after replacing the expired certificate, as the browser caches your certificate information. We recommend that you replace a certificate before expiration to avoid any impact on your business.
