### Can I apply for an SSL certificate before activating website services?
You can apply for a paid or free SSL certificate only if you have a domain name and resolution permission.
>!If you have not purchased any Tencent Cloud service resources when you apply for an SSL certificate, the file verification method will not be supported during certificate verification.
