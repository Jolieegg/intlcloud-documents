### How do I receive SSL certificate expiration notifications from the system?

Before a certificate expires, log in to the [Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl) and check the certificate expiration information in the **Expiry date** column on the **Certificate Management** page.
Alternatively, you can configure message subscriptions to receive certificate-related system notifications.

>- If message subscriptions are not configured and **SSL certificate notifications** and **Product service notifications** are not selected under **Product notifications**, you will not receive certificate expiration notifications through the Message Center, email, or SMS.
>- For certificates of other vendors uploaded to Tencent Cloud, if message subscriptions are configured for them, you will also receive certificate expiration notifications.

**Certificate expiration notification time**: the renewal channel will be opened within 30 days before certificate expiration, and the expiration reminder will be sent the next day after the renewal channel is opened.
