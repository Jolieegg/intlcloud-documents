### What should I do if I don't know where to modify an organization profile?

Currently, the organization profile of an SSL certificate cannot be modified or deleted; therefore, we recommend that you create a new one for review.

### How many instances can be created in my profile?

Up to 10 organization profiles can be added. If you need to add more, [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).

### How long does it take to review an organization profile?

The review is generally completed within one business day. Be sure not to miss the call from the CA.

> **Notes**
> 
> The CA will prioritize organization profiles of paid certificates if there are a large number of applications.
