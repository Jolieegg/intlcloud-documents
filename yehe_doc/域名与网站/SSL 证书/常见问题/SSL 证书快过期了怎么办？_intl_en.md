### What should I do If an SSL certificate is expired?
A paid SSL certificate becomes invalid once it expires. Before the expiration, you need to renew it, bind to the domain name again, and submit an application for approval.

Once your application is approved, you will obtain a new SSL certificate. Install it on the server to replace the original one before it expires.

>- If you are using a free domain-validated (DV) certificate, you need to apply for a new one before the current one expires.
>- You are advised to renew the certificate 3 to 10 business days before expiration to avoid impacting your business.
