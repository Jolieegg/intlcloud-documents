### How many free certificates can I apply for from Tencent Cloud?

| Category | Quota|
|---------|---------|
| Tencent Cloud root account | 20 |
| Primary domain | 20 |

- Each Tencent Cloud root account has a quota of 20 free certificates that can be applied for at any given time.
- Each primary domain has a quota of 20 free TrustAsia DV SSL certificates that can be applied for at any given time.

>!
>- Both a second-level domain and its subdomains are deemed under the primary domain. For example, `tencent.com`, `ssl.tencent.com`, and `ssl.ssl.tencent.com` are under the same primary domain.
>- Free TrustAsia DV SSL certificates issued by other platforms for the same primary domain are also counted in the quota.


## How is the quota of free certificates under a Tencent Cloud root account replenished?

The quota is replenished immediately after the free certificates are revoked or expire.

## How is the quota of free certificates under a primary domain replenished?

The quota is replenished only after certificates expire; certificate revocation or deletion will not replenish the quota.

## When I apply for a new free certificate, which is deducted first: the free certificate quota or the quota in a free certificate package?

The free certificate quota is deducted first. If it is used up, the quota in a free certificate package is deducted.
