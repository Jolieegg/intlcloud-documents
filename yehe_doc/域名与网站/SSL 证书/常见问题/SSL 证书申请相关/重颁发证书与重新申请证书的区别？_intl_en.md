### Whatâ€™s the difference between certificate reissue and reapplication?
The difference mainly lies in whether the certificate is generated based on the original order.
- Reissued certificate: The expiration date will not be changed. Regardless of whether the certificate is free or paid, you cannot modify the domain name bound with it.
- Reapplied certificate: You can change the certificate information. If the certificate was free, the reapplication uses another free tier. If the certificate was a paid one, you will have to pay for it again.
