### Can I revoke certificates?
Currently, Tencent Cloud only supports offline certificate revocations. Please submit a ticket to contact Tencent Cloud engineers for certificate revocation.
For more information about the revocation procedure for DV certificates, see [DV Certificate Revocation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30174).
