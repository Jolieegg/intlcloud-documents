## Overview

To facilitate the management of certificates that are no longer needed, Tencent Cloud provides the certificate revocation feature. You can apply for revocation of SSL certificates on Tencent Cloud.
Generally, you may revoke SSL certificates in the following scenarios:
- You do not need to continue using the issued certificates.

- For security reasons, the issued certificates are no longer used.

   > 
   > If an issued certificate has not expired, you can delete it from the certificate list only after the certificate is revoked. A certificate that has not been revoked cannot be deleted.
