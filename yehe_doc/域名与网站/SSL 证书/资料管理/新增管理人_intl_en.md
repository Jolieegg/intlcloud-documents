## Overview

There can be multiple administrators in the organization profile. You can configure the administrator information and have it reviewed in advance so that you can directly submit it during certificate application. In this way, you don't need to repeatedly enter the administrator information when applying for multiple certificates and can skip the information review, accelerating the process.
