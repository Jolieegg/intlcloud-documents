The private key password is an optional parameter when applying for a certificate.

1. **Make sure** to remember the private key password after filling it in as it is not retrievable or modifiable.
2. The password may be required for certain operations on your server such as importing, exporting, and installing the certificate.
3. If you forgot the private key password, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=1&level2_id=320&level1_name=%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E7%B1%BB%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98&level2_name=SSL%E8%AF%81%E4%B9%A6) to ask Tencent Cloud engineers to delete the certificate and re-apply for the domain name certificate.
