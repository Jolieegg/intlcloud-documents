## Scenarios
This document describes how to install an SSL certificate on an Apache server.
>
>- The certificate `www.domain.com` is used as an example.
>- `Apache/2.4.6` is used as an example. The default port is `80`.
>- The current server OS is CentOS 7. The detailed steps vary slightly by OS version.

## Prerequisites
- A remote file copy tool such as WinSCP has been installed. You are recommended to download the latest version from the official website.
- A remote login tool such as PuTTY or Xshell has been installed. You are recommended to download the latest version from the official website.
- You have configured Apache service on the current server.
- Before you install the SSL certificate, you must have the following information.
<table>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Server IP address</td>
<td>IP address of the server, which is used to connect the PC to the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Username</td>
<td>The username used to log in to the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>The password used to log in to the server.</td>
</tr>
</table>

>For a CVM instance purchased on the Tencent Cloud official website, you can log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) to get the server IP address, username, and password.

## Directions

### Certificate installation
1. Download the certificate package `www.domain.com` from the [SSL Certificate Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl) and decompress it to a local directory.
You must have obtained the certificate files, including the Apache folder and CSR file:
 - **Folder name**: Apache
 - **Folder content**:
    - `1_root_bundle.crt`: certificate file
    - `2_www.domain.com.crt`: certificate file
    - `3_www.domain.com.key`: private key file
  - **CSR file**: `www.domain.com.csr` file
  >The CSR file is uploaded by you or generated by the system when you apply for the certificate and is provided to the CA. It is irrelevant to the installation.
2. Log in to the Apache server using WinSCP (a tool for copying files between a local computer and a remote computer).
3. Copy the obtained certificate files `1_root_bundle.crt` and `2_www.domain.com.crt` and the private key file `3_www.domain.com.key` from the local directory to the `/etc/httpd/ssl` directory of the Apache server.
> 
>- If the `/etc/httpd/ssl` directory does not exist, run the `mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl` command to create one.
4. Remotely log in to the Apache server. For example, you can use [PuTTY](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502) for remote login.
>For a newly installed Apache server, the files `conf.d`, `conf`, and `conf.modules.d` are in the `/etc/httpd` directory by default.
5. In the `httpd.conf` configuration file of the `/etc/httpd/conf` directory, find the `Include conf.modules.d/*.conf` configuration statement (for loading the SSL configuration directory) and check whether it is commented out. If it is commented out, delete the comment symbol (`#`) from the first line and save the configuration file.
6. In the `00-ssl.conf` configuration file of the `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d` directory, find the `LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so` configuration statement (for loading the SSL module) and check whether it is commented out. If it is commented out, delete the comment symbol (`#`) from the first line and save the configuration file.
 > Because directory structures vary with OS versions, search for the configuration statement based on the OS version you use.
> If the configuration statements `LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so` and `Include conf.modules.d/*.conf` are not found in the files mentioned above, check whether the mod_ssl.so module has been installed. If no, run the `yum install mod_ssl` command to install it.
7. Edit the 'ssl.conf' configuration file in the `/etc/httpd/conf.d` directory by modifying the following:
```
<VirtualHost 0.0.0.0:443>
		DocumentRoot "/var/www/html" 
		#Enter the certificate name
		ServerName www.domain.com 
		# Enable SSL
		SSLEngine on 
		#Enter the path where the certificate resides
		SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl/2_www.domain.com.crt 
		#Enter the path where the private key resides
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl/3_www.domain.com.key 
		#Enter the path where the certificate chain resides
		SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/httpd/ssl/1_root_bundle.crt 
</VirtualHost>
```
8. Restart the Apache server and then it can be accessed via `https://www.domain.com`.

### Security configuration for automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS (optional)
If you do not know how to configure website access over HTTPS, you can configure the server to make it automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS through the following steps:
1. Edit the httpd.conf configuration file in the `/etc/httpd/conf` directory.
>
>- The directory structure varies by Apache version. For more information, see [Apache Module mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html).
>- httpd.conf is located in more than one directories. You can filter them by `/etc/httpd/*`.
2. Check whether `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so` is in it.
 - If yes, remove the comment symbol (`#`) in front of `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so` and proceed to [step 4](#step4).
 - Otherwise, proceed to [step 3](#step3).
 <span id="step3"></span>
3. Create a new \*.conf file such as 00-rewrite.conf in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d` and add the following to it:
 ```
 LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
```
<span id="step4"></span>
4. Add the following to the httpd.conf configuration file:
```
<Directory "/var/www/html"> 
# Add the following:
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !^443$
RewriteRule ^(.*)?$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R]
</Directory>
```
5. Restart the Apache server and then it can be accessed using `http://www.domain.com`.
