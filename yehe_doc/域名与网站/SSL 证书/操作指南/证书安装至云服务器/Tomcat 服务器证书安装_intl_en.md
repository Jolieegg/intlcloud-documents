## Scenarios
This document describes how to install an SSL certificate on a Tomcat server.
>
>- The certificate `www.domain.com` is used as an example.
>- `Tomcat 7.0.94` is used as an example.
>- The current server OS is CentOS 7. The detailed steps vary slightly with the OS version.

## Prerequisites
- A remote file copy tool such as WinSCP has been installed. You are recommended to download the latest version from the official website.
- A remote login tool such as PuTTY or Xshell has been installed. You are recommended to download the latest version from the official website.
- The Tomcat server has been installed and configured on the current server.
- Before you install the SSL certificate, you must have the following information.
<table>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Server IP address</td>
<td>IP address of the server, which is used to connect the PC to the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Username</td>
<td>The username used to log in to the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td>The password used to log in to the server.</td>
</tr>
</table>

>- If your server is a Tencent Cloud CVM instance, you can log in to [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) to obtain the IP address, username, and password of the server.
- If you selected the **Paste CSR** method when applying for the SSL certificate, the option to download the Tomcat certificate file is not provided. Instead, you manually convert the format to generate a keystore. The procedures are as follows. 
 - Access the [conversion tool](https://myssl.com/cert_convert.html).
 - Upload the certificate and private key files in the Nginx folder to the conversion tool, enter the keystore password, click **Submit**, and convert the certificate to a JKS certificate.
- Currently, the Tomcat server is installed in the `/usr` directory. For example, if the Tomcat folder name is `tomcat7.0.94`, then `/usr/*/conf` is actually `/usr/tomcat7.0.94/conf`.


## Directions

### Certificate Installation
1. On the **Certificate Management** page of the SSL Certificate Service console, download the `www.domain.com` certificate and decompress it to a local directory.
You have obtained the certificate files, including the Tomcat file folder and CSR file:
 - **Folder name**: Tomcat
 - **Folder content**:
    - `www.domain.com.jks`: keystore file
    - `keystorePass.txt`: password file (If you have already set a private key password, there is no `keystorePass.txt` file in this folder.)
  - **CSR file**: `www.domain.com.csr` file
  >The CSR file is uploaded by you or generated by the system when you apply for the certificate and is provided to the CA. It is irrelevant to the installation.
2. Log in to the Tomcat server using WinSCP (a tool for copying files between a local computer and a remote computer).
3. Copy the obtained `www.domain.com.jks` keystore file from the local directory to the `/usr/*/conf` directory.
4. Remotely log in to the Tomcat server. For example, you can use [PuTTY](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502) for remote login.
5. Edit the `server.xml` file in the `/usr/*/conf` directory by adding the following:
```
<Connector port="443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
  maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
#Enter the path where the certificate is saved
  keystoreFile="/usr/*/conf/www.domain.com.jks" 
#Enter the keystore password
  keystorePass="******"
  clientAuth="false"/>
```
For details of the `server.xml` file, see the following:
>To prevent format errors, it is not recommended to copy the content of `server.xml` file.

```
The main parameters of the configuration file are the following.
 - **keystoreFile**: where the keystore file is saved. You can specify an absolute path or a relative path to the <CATALINA_HOME> (Tomcat installation directory) environment variable. If this parameter is not set, by default, Tomcat reads the file named ".keystore" from the user directory of the current operating system user.
 - **keystorePass**: keystore password. If you set a private key password when applying for the certificate, enter the private key password; otherwise, enter the password in the keystorePass.txt file in the Tomcat folder.
 - **clientAuth**: if it is set to true, Tomcat requires all SSL clients to provide a security certificate for identity verification.
6. Confirm whether the Tomcat server is started.
   - If the Tomcat server is already started, you need to run the following commands in sequence in the `/usr/*/bin` directory to shut down and restart it.
```
./shutdown.sh  (Shut down the Tomcat server)
./startup.sh (Start the Tomcat server)
```
 - If the Tomcat server is not started, you need to run the following command in the `/usr/*/bin` directory to start it.
 ```
./startup.sh
 ```
7. After it is started successfully, it can be accessed using `https://www.domain.com`.

### Security Configuration for Automatic Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS (Optional)

If you do not know how to configure website access over HTTPS, you can configure the server to make it automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS through the following steps:
1. Edit the `web.xml` file in the `/usr/*/conf` directory and find the `</welcome-file-list>` tag.
2. Insert a new line below `</welcome-file-list>` and add the following:
```
<login-config>
    <!-- Authorization setting for SSL -->
    <auth-method>CLIENT-CERT</auth-method>
    <realm-name>Client Cert Users-only Area</realm-name>
    </login-config>
    <security-constraint>
    <!-- Authorization setting for SSL -->
    <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>SSL</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <user-data-constraint>
    <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
```
3. Edit the `server.xml` file in the `/usr/*/conf` directory and modify the `redirectPort` parameter to port 443, the port of the SSL connector, as shown below:
```
<Connector port="80" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
  connectionTimeout="20000"
  redirectPort="443" />
```
> This modification redirects a non-SSL connector to an SSL connector.
>
4. Shut down the Tomcat server by running the following command in the ` /usr/*/bin` directory.
```
./shutdown.sh
```
5. Run the following command to confirm whether there is a problem with the configuration.
```
./configtest.sh
```
 - If yes, reconfigure or fix the problem as prompted.
 - If no, proceed to the next step.
6. Run the following command to start the Tomcat server and then it can be accessed using `http://www.domain.com`.
```
./startup.sh
```
