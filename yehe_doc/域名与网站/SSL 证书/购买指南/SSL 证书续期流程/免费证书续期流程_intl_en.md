Due to changes in Apple and Google root store policies, global CAs have ceased issuing SSL certificates with a validity period greater than two years since September 1, 2020. Therefore, renewing an SSL certificate is equivalent to applying for a new one in the console, and the old certificate will not have a longer validity period. After the new certificate is issued, you need to reinstall it on the server, which takes effect upon deployment.
For detailed directions on how to install a certificate, see [Installing Certificate](https://write.woa.com/#certificate). If the old certificate is within the validity period, its use will not be affected.

## Renewal Process for Free Certificates

### Step 1. Quickly apply for a new free certificate
1. For a free certificate, the quick renewal option will become available **one month before its expiration date**. You can open the **Quick Certification Reapplication** page by clicking **Quick Renewal** in the **Status** column of the certificate in **My Certificates** in the [SSL Certificate Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl).

2. On the **Submit Information** page, confirm your application and click **Next** to enter the **Select Validation Method** page.

### Step 2. Validate the domain
1. On the **Select Validation Method** page, select the validation method.

  - **Adds DNS validation automatically**: For more information, see [Details](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1007/53635).

   >   - Passed: The domain validation has been passed.

3. After the domain validation is passed, the CA will issue the certificate within 24 hours.
