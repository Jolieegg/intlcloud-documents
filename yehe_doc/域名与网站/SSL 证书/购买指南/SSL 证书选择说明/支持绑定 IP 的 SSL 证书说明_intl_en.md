The following table describes the support for IP address binding by different SSL certificates:
>?
>- You can apply for free certificates only for single domains, but not for wildcard domains and multi-domains.
>- Single-domain or multi-domain refers to the domain type you selected on the [SSL Certificate Service buy page](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/ssl).
>- `-` indicates that this type of certificate is not available for sale in Tencent Cloud.
>- A private CA certificate can be bound with a private IP, but both a free certificate and a standard paid certificate cannot be bound with a private IP.
