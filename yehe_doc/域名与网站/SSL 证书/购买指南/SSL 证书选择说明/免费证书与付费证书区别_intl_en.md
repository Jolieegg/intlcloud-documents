## Free certificate

A free certificate provided by Tencent Cloud is a TrustAsia domain validation (DV) SSL certificate, to which only one complete domain can be bound, for example, `tencent.com`, `cloud.tencent.com`, and other second-level domains or subdomains. Wildcards are not supported, and IPs cannot be bound.

## Paid certificate

A paid SSL certificate provided by Tencent Cloud can be a DV, OV, EV, or EV Pro certificate. All of them except DV ones require strict identity review and verification of the applicant during application, including but not limited to domain ownership verification and trusted identity certification.

## Common features of free and paid certificates
- Both can be used for encrypting the network transfer protocol HTTP.

- Both are beneficial to search engine collection and optimization.


## Differences between free and paid certificates
- Strict identity review and verification: A free SSL certificate requires only domain ownership verification but not trusted identity certification, while a paid one requires strict identity review and verification. Identity verification allows for verifying the website authenticity to stay away from intermediate attacks or phishing websites. This helps build trust in the authenticity of a website.

- SLA guarantee: A free certificate has no SLA guarantees.

- A paid certificate is better for search engine optimization due to authenticity.

- A paid certificate supports more domain types (including wildcard domains) and IP binding. For more information, see [Pricing | SSL Certificate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/ssl).

- A paid certificate features stronger encrypted transfer capabilities.
