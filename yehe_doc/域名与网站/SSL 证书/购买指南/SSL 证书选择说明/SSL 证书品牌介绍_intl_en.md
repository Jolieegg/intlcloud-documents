## Brand Differences
The certificates of different brands vary depending on the browser address bar, encryption level, and the level guaranteed compensation. The most important difference lies in their root certificates as follows:
- A TrustAsia wildcard certificate is issued using a Sectigo root certificate. Serving more than 150 countries/regions, Sectigo is a world-leading CA with a long history. It also supports OCSP nodes in the Chinese mainland with faster response.
- A GeoTrust wildcard certificate is issued using a GeoTrust root certificate, a SecureSite wildcard certificate using a SecureSite root certificate, and a DigiCert wildcard certificate using a DigiCert root certificate.
- A GlobalSign wildcard certificate is issued using a GlobalSign root certificate, a DNSPod certificate using a WoTrus root certificate, and a WoTrus wildcard certificate using a Sectigo root certificate.

From a technical point of view, the differences between SecureSite (former VeriSign) and GeoTrust are as follows:
- Compatibility: SecureSite outperforms GeoTrust. SecureSite is compatible with all browsers commercially available and many mobile devices.
