<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Description</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Single-domain</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Only one domain can be bound. The domain can be a second-level domain such as `tencent.com` or a third-level domain such as `example.tencent.com`.</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Binding all subdomains under a second-level domain is not supported.<br>Up to 100 levels of domains are supported.<br>An SSL certificate bound to the domain `www.tencent.com` (`www` as the subdomain) supports the second-level domain `tencent.com`.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Multi-domain</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >A certificate can be bound to multiple domains, subject to the maximum number of domains displayed in the console.</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >The prices of SecureSite multi-domain certificates are calculated based on the number of domains.<br>For the GeoTrust, TrustAsia, GlobalSign, WoTrus, and DNSPod multi-domain certificates, there are additional charges for the domains that exceed the default maximum number of domains supported.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Wildcard domain</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >One and only one wildcard domain can be bound, and only one wildcard can be added.</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >For example, `\*.tencent.com` and `\*.example.tencent.com` support up to 100 levels.<br>Multi-wildcard domains such as `\*.\*.tencent.com` are not supported.<br>An SSL certificate bound to the domain `\*.tencent.com` (which must be a second-level wildcard domain) supports the second-level domain `tencent.com`.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Multiple wildcard domains</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >Multiple wildcard domains can be bound.</td>
<td rowspan="1" colSpan="1" >For example, `\*.tencent.com`, `\*.ssl.tencent.com`, and `\*.another.com` are counted as a total of three wildcard domains, including all the subdomains at the same level, subject to the maximum number of domains displayed in the console.</td>
</tr>
</table>




### Step 4. Select the certificate validity period

Due to changes in Apple and Google root store policies, newly issued SSL/TLS certificates with a validity period greater than 13 months (397 days) have been prohibited by policy since September 1, 2020. Therefore, global CAs have ceased issuing such certificates since September 1, 2020.
**Currently, only certain multi-year SSL certificates are available from Tencent Cloud (others available are all SSL certificates with a validity period of 13 months). Within 30 days before expiration of your current multi-year certificate, Tencent Cloud will automatically apply for a new one for you, which will be automatically issued upon CA approval.**

>?
> 
> - Available multi-year SSL certificate brands and types are as displayed on the purchase page.
> - If the original certificate is installed at the server website, you need to replace it with a newly issued one as instructed in [Selecting an Installation Type for an SSL Certificate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30173).


### Step 5. Pay for your order

After selecting the brand, model, supported domain name, and certificate validity period, you can submit your order and complete the payment process.
