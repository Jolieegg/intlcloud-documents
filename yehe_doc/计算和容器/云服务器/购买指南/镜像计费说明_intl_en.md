### Image billing for OS reinstallation
- You can switch the OS of an instance between Red Hat Enterprise Linux and others. In this case, the image fee is calculated based on the new image. Note that you cannot switch between Windows OS and Linux OS in regions outside the Chinese mainland. 
- For a pay-as-you-go instance, when the OS is reinstalled to licensed Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the image is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. If the Red Hat Enterprise Linux image is used during a billing cycle, you need to pay for the image license fee for the cycle.
**Example**:
You purchased a CentOS instance at 8:00 am on January 1, 2023. No image license fee occurred during 8:00 - 9:00 am. At 9:30 am, you reinstalled the instance OS with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and you need to pay for the image license for the billing cycle 9:00 - 10:00 am. At 10:30 am, you reinstalled the instance OS with CentOS, and you need to pay for the image license for the billing cycle 10:00 - 11:00 am. After 11:00 am, you do not need to pay for the image license.

### Billing under [RI](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/213/30571) mode
- When you select RI for a Linux instance, you need to pay for the license for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux image separately.
- A pay-as-you-go instance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux image licensed in Tencent Cloud can enjoy a discount when the instance configuration matches RI. However the discount is not available to the image license, which is billed separately.


### Configuration modification

You cannot change the configuration and the billing mode for an instance with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS.
