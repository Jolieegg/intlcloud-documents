>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resources when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the partner.

## Notes

- To avoid affecting your business, make sure to renew your monthly subscribed instances promptly, or enable the [automatic renewal](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1167/51928) feature and make sure that your account balance is sufficient.
- Pay-as-you-go resources are postpaid hourly, with fees deducted on the hour. Make sure that your account balance is sufficient.
- After your account has an overdue CVD payment, your CVD instance can be used normally for 24 hours, with billing continued. After 24 hours, the instance will be isolated and become inaccessible, with billing stopped. If your instance is not renewed within seven (included) days of suspension, the system will release the resources in around 24 hours. After release, all data in the instance will be cleared and cannot be recovered.
- When you no longer use CVD instances, **[terminate/return](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1167/51935)** them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
