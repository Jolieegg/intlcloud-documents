>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

## Daily Pay-As-You-Go
If you use the daily pay-as-you-go mode, fees will be deducted from your account balance. If your account has insufficient balance, MPS will finish all ongoing transcoding tasks first and then suspend services for your account. Services will resume only after you make the payment and your available credit becomes positive. The default billing cycle is daily. If you want to change to monthly billing, please contact your sales rep.

## Monthly Pay-As-You-Go
For [monthly pay-as-you-go](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041/33478#month), the unit prices specified in your contract with Tencent Cloud will apply. For more information, please contact your sales rep.

## Prepaid Resource Packs
MPS resource packs are valid for one year. MPS will send you alerts before a resource pack expires or is exhausted. You cannot use resource packs or the MPS console if your account has overdue payments.

### Expiration alerts
Seven days, three days, and one day before a resource pack expires, MPS will send alerts via SMS to the account creator and all its collaborators.

### Exhaustion alerts
When 90% of a resource pack is used, MPS will send alerts via SMS to the account creator and all its collaborators.
>! If there are no available resource packs in your account, fees will be deducted from your account balance in the daily pay-as-you-go mode. To avoid service suspension caused by overdue payments, please pay attention to the remaining minutes in your resource packs and buy new packs or top up your account in a timely manner.

## Service Suspension
MPS will suspend services for accounts that have overdue payments.
+ The fees incurred each day are billed and deducted from your account balance between 12:00 and 18:00 the following day.
+ If deduction fails due to insufficient balance, you will receive a payment overdue notification via SMS on the same day. If you fail to make the payment within 24 hours, MPS will suspend services for your accounts.
+ You will be unable to use the console after service suspension. However, MPS will not delete or modify your transcoding files and configurations.
