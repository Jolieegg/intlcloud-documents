>! If you are a customer of a Tencent Cloud partner, the rules regarding resource lifecycle when there are overdue payments are subject to the agreement between you and the reseller.

### Overdue Payments and Service Suspension
- StreamLink fees are billed in the pay-as-you-go mode. Fees incurred each day are deducted from your account balance the following day.
- Tencent Cloud will send you alerts when your account has overdue payments. You have **72 hours** to top up your account. **If you fail to make the payment within 72 hours, we will suspend StreamLink services for your account. After service suspension, you will be unable to use the StreamLink console or APIs.**


### Repossession of Resources
If you still fail to top up your account **60 days** after service suspension, StreamLink will repossess its resources. In addition, Tencent Cloud clears data for suspended services at regular times. The data related to StreamLink under your account will be cleared the next time Tencent Cloud clears such data. Cleared data cannot be recovered.
